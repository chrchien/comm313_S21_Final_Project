Kostas got a bucket that's all you need to know about this game.
Fun random fact - Andre Drummond has officially swept the Nets this season
Blow-out expected... Blow-out happened...
Can't believe the league allowed Caruso to have prime McLemore smh
WHAT
If the Nets can make Drummond look like Shaq, ADs gonna be Shaq on steroids
Sixers and Nets are both determined to not hold the 1 seed for more than a day
Lakers blowout win, as expected.
# EVERYONE GET IN HERE AND OVERREACT !!!!
Vogel is a genius
we won the buyout bowl
is this the first time we shoot 50% at 3pt lol?
The Los Angeles Lakers (33-20) defeat the Brooklyn Nets (36-17), 126-101 in the Buyout Invitational.
A THUNDERSTORM IS COMING ⛈☔️
This lakers defense is a real problem, you don’t really understand #2 in the league without their stars until you see it, and although nets probably win with harden, the system Vogel has put in for this team is so much better than any fan would have expected without their two stars
Just happy to get wins here and there while LeBron and AD are out. Not gonna hot take too much beyond that, shit’s weird this season.
Mclemore is the greatest shooter of all time
Where’s the “trade THT” crowd tonight?
Drummond looked like prime Shaq tonight lmfao.
Back to first WOOOOO thanks lakers bros
Coach Vogel is elite. A masterclass tonight from everyone.
Imagine getting run by this this Lakers team with no Bron, AD, Marc, Kuz or Wes
Seems like Harden is Brooklyn most important player
Good luck to the top seed that's getting the Lakers in the first round.
Lakers defense is insane, their pre rotations are absurd 

THT's best abilities rn is ball handling, finishing, and he's a really good passer. it's when he decides from the start i'm gonna score, that's a problem 


KCP did a decent job on KD, fouled him on the three, but aside from that chased him around well, and contested one on one and that's really all you can ask for against him 

lakers spacing is so dumb sometimes, the play where Harrell got blocked by Claxton, why is Ben Mclemore on the baseline instead of spreading out. Morris flagrant on Kyrie, Caruso not going to the other side made it so KD is right there and Morris has absolutely no spacing to make any move

illegal screens are so weird cause it'll get called and the announcers will be like "clearly an offensive foul" and i'm like is it clear? i see that exact same screen 48 times a game it just happened to get called now
Thank you Laker bros very cool.
That's why Lakers don't trade Shroder/KCP/THT and picks for Lowry
How tf did we win
Nets couldn't contain Drummond. LeBron and AD will be interesting.
Straight up spanking. Lakers defense is nice
Lakers staying afloat with Bron and AD out and other injuries keeping other players out during this run is absolutely incredible
They got exposed, Nets play absolutely no D. Lakers have the better depth by FAR and it’s not even close.
You just know Shannon is going to go in on Skip about this on Monday LMAO
Man the nets role players are way worse than I realized we shot wide open shots all night and their interior defense is non existent if claxton isn’t out there.
B3n McL3mor3!!! 🔥🔥🔥
People in this sub tried to shit on THT and call him a preseason fluke because he had 3 points the game after not getting traded against the Sixers. He’s been decent since LeBron been out
Lakers won this one by +20, as we all expected
Defense matters.
Lol at the Drummond haters.
Nets have really got MFs cheering for the Lakers lol. Wild af timeline
i dont think Kyrie likes the optics that Harden is now the man in BKN. kyrie is 3rd banana
KD can’t carry nuff said
Nah this thread better have 2k comments minimum, all the shit said in the last two weeks
KD on the parking lot calling tht to join the Lakeshow rn
ALL WITHOUT JARED DUDLEY 😮
Ah, as predicted the Lakers star Big man and SF blew out the Nets
The Nets can't defend for shit.  It doesn't matter in the regular season but you're delusional if you think they have any hope in hell against a healthy Lakers team.  Not a reactionary take.  They've never even been my pick to win the ECF.
#[LAKERS ROAD TO CHAMPIONS 52-20](https://streamable.com/9bhkw)
The classic trap game for the Nets. A good deal of our rotation players out, playing against an elite team on the road. Figures we'd get a win like this eventually
Defense wins championships
SHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIIIIITTTT (In my Clay Davis voice)
Everyone says Drummond stats were empty, but we will not win this game w/o him
Drummond such a good pickup, well played by the Lakeshow overall.
Was this embarrassing? Probably.

Was this a great game by the Lakers bench death sqaud? ABSOLUTELY!!!!
*Sees score* Oh neat did AD or LeBron come back?

*Checks box score* The f*ck
Holy shit this felt good
[Mood for tonight](https://media.tenor.com/images/8b371e5406316a070838adf8c0aeb105/tenor.gif)
I was told Brooklyn was unbeatable.
This definitely one of the most stinging losses in a while. Up there with that Wizards comeback, and Sexton going Godzilla on us. I hope we learn from this. Lakers had a hell of a night, especially with Drummond. GG 

Still maintaining those ejections were weak af though
Fuck the Nets for making me root for the Lakers

Esp in the Finals
I watched the whole game and Tucker played much better than stats suggest. he was 4/16 but he was quite aggressive, played with the flow of the game. In the first half, he forced some shots for like 3 possessions in a row, thats the only fault I can find. Nice game by Lakers.
Its time to face the truth: NOBODY is beating a healthy Lakers team in a 7 game series and I am sorry for all the nets fan but the healthy Lakers toughest matchup is not the Nets.

And no excuses for this loss lakers were missing the 2 best player and Nets had KD.
Lakers B team made the Nets look like the Lakers B team
Lakers tonight https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2YSNoOD
Finally settles the debate of which team is better...without 2 stars.  But really we were keeping it close even with Kyrie in, Harden is so much more instrumental than given credit for

* Refs threw out Schroder who stood there confused while Kyrie went Karen on him
* THT growing up right before our eyes
* Drummond haters in shambles
* McLemore with a nice 2nd half bounce back
* Great team game
* Lebron's coat was fly
* Kuz wore cowboy chaps
I can't believe the Lakers made 19 threes and the nets only 5. If u have seen both teams shoot all season this would seem impossible. Good job Lakers.
Ben Macklemore showed his potential today
Bruh.

How do you manage to lose to us.
this Nets defense ...lmao. this Lakers supporting cast is gaining crazy crazy confidence
I know our offense has generally looked like shit without Bron and AD, but fuck if our defense isn't beautiful to look at. Obviously no team can play perfect D all the time, but we consistently demonstrate what a competent defensive scheme looks like: there's a purpose every rotation, every assignment and switch. We might not be able to stop somebody from popping off, but a lot of possessions you can tell we're baiting our opponents into suboptimal options. 

I don't expect the Nets to be walked over in the playoffs like today, but even a narrow loss would've been impressive and we fucking blew them out. Incredible effort.
How is Skip gonna excuse this one away?
I cry tonight  


good game, LA.
Without AD this LAkers team has maintained a top 5 D. That's scary for the rest of the league.
- Tunes in to Saturday Night Primetime game
- Surprisingly good game, even with all of the Lakers injuries
- Dennis and Kyrie both going off, competitive banter adding drama to the game
- Ref says FUCK NO and ejects both
- Game ruined
- Love that NBA Product!
Lakers held the Nets, who average 119ppg, to 101.
I know Harden wasn't in the game, but honestly, Brooklyn with just Kyrie and KD should be steamrolling a Lakers team without LeBron or AD.

I'm still not convinced Brooklyn is the East favourite
Lakers defense is lethal
[/r/NBA Mood](https://i.imgur.com/f9fcNA5.jpg)
Yeah the Lakers are built different. No matter if we are shooting well or not, we play D. We're built for the playoffs.
Can’t say I expected this gift from the Lakers
Goddamn it why didn't the Lakers let the subs play when they have a huge lead?


Oh wait they are playing the bench already
This is not even the Storm yet
losing to the b team lol
Nick Wright is going to own Brandon Marshall on Monday
Imagine this team with lebron and AD
Nets can’t defend a car with 4 flat tires.
Kyrie about to take 3 months off
Yesterday someone said they dont need to start kd or irving to beat the lakers because we have Joe " better then kcp, tht , drummond , kuzma , montrel " harris
Most hilarious game of the season.. Probably the most hilarious game in years. It was the Lakers 3rd unit

>

Embarrassing for the Nets.. and those players.  Maybe just 4-5 Superstars/All Stars ain't enough
**LMFAOOOOO GET IN HERE**
A team vs a bunch of names, that's it.
My phone was black before the Lakers game. It's white now.
Nets had no answer for Drummond holy wow. Good D for the Lakers as well.
Now imagine when the two best players come back with Lebron and AD at their best come playoff time.
Both teams have a round a piece. God if this ends up really being the finals match up the NBA and the world will have a civil war.
Wow a blowout just like we all thought would happen...
Good game lakers. Now I can't watch espn or fs1 for a week.
Mclemore + Drummond > LMA + Griffin

AD + Lebron + Schroder > KD + Harden + Kyrie

Idgaf what anybody says Lakers still the best team in the league when healthy
Let’s be honest. This doesn’t tell us much. Except that the Nets aren’t making the finals 😂
A bunch of fucking nephews are going to complain about Kyrie being ejected, but he deserved it. He got up in Dennis’s face and refused to cool himself off, the refs even gave him a chance and he just did not stop, Durant didn’t even look shocked, he shook his head and understood. 


Now let’s get into the actual game, the Lakers team defence is absolutely stifling and THT is an absolute talent! He looked like an absolute star, handling the ball, initiating the offence and those long arms on defence really caused some havoc. They really shut down the Brooklyn role players and caused havoc in the passing lanes and on the rebounds. 


Yet again, many nephews were complaining about the addition of Blake Griffin to this nets team, but he literally can’t play defence anymore. He may be decent offensively but just because you can hit an open dunk does not mean you are an all star. Korver was dunking two seasons ago. 


Drummond is also an amazing addition to the Lakers squad, he really caused issues for Aldridge when he put the ball on the floor and got inside. 


This is a huge win for the Lakers and a morale boost regardless of the Kyrie shenanigans. 


Obviously the nets were without Harden and the Lakers were without Ad, Bron and Kuzma, but even before that the Lakers were really showing a lot of heart, keeping themselves ahead and finding mismatches on the defensive end (putting Claxton in pick and rolls, using Kieff on smaller guys etc.) 



And lastly, Montrezl is literally a nothing burger without someone setting up for him.
Jesus. Without Lebron and AD, too?
Well this is a pleasant surprise
Nets have lost all games this year when AD has played. Andre Drummond.
This game was not what I was eхpecting ...on many fronts...
I thought they'd get a trap win on this road trip. Didn't think it'd be this game though
Lakers built different! Great W!
Who really knew Ben Mclemore is the third all star of this team! What a game lol
LOL, so much for a super team 😂
Team Injured vs Team no defense. Close game.
This game really made me miss Jarrett Allen :(
That defense was so damn impressive to see, KD missed some jumpers early he usually makes, but KCP was hounding him.
Nets did not come ready to play. Kudos to the Lakers. Should be a fun finals.
Fake superteam
This DOES bring a smile to my face.
Empires fall, but not TONIGHT Brooklyn
That defense though... *slow clap* 👏
I like the energy tonight from our guys!
They trynna be cray
Shoutout to Coach Vogel for DAT DEFENSE
McLemore Goat
Man, even before the game, even without LBJ and AD, the Lakers line up still looked very strong, I'd say may even be considered as a very viable line up worthy of getting in the playoffs with any other team. People only see them weak because the two stars are sidlined but I say, the team still looks good. Not top tier but good enough.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Harden was sitting on the bench sweating.
LeBron balled out but Davis was great too
Such an important win
Pray for Skip, if tonight didn't kill him, Shannon will
McLemore too unfair. LeBron tapping into that potential
No lebron, no AD. all i’m hearing is LAKERS IN 6
I’m psyched about the win but refs really ruined a great game with the double ejections
Another takeaway from this game...Aldridge was helpless against Drummond. Nets counter by going to small to play Drummond off the floor. Which in a potential matchup means the Lakers get what the want, a bunch of small dudes with AD and LeBron on the floor and no rim protection for the Nets. Lakers and Vogel want teams to go small against them.
The weatherman says the weather is changing soon and it predicts a thunderstorm ⛈ ☔️ is coming. Folks prepare and take proper caution ⚠️ ⛔️ measures to stay safe
The Nets got a taste of what championship level defense looks  like.
Nba so soft for those ejections
Great win by the Lakers. The Nets have some weaknesses, and the Lakers may have the only defense capable of slowing down the Nets offense in the playoffs in my opinion. The Lakers are the best defensive team, in addition to an elite rebounding team. The Nets have a bottom 5 defense in the league, and it is really bad. And they are around an average-bad rebounding team. They are ranked 20th  for allowed opponent offensive boards a game. If the Nets don't solve their defense and rebounding issues, then Philly or Milwaukee may beat them in the playoffs, before they play a team like the Lakers in the finals. 

I do think at the end of the day, that we can't draw to conclusions about this game. LeBron, AD, Kuzma, and Matthews were missing for the Lakers. Harden was missing, and I think at this point, is the Nets best player. Harden completely elevates the whole team with his playmaking and he is their most impactful player. Similar to LeBron's impact on the Lakers. KD was on his 2nd game back from a hamstring strain and clearly is not 100 percent yet (I think he missed like 24 games). Kyrie and Schroeder were both ejected for half the game. 

It might be a great morale boost for the Lakers until AD and LeBron get back, but I don't think we can 100 percent make any takes about this game. We need to see both teams at full health, with their key players available. I am leaning towards the Lakers being the better team overall with less weaknesses, but the Nets offensive ability and shooting will be an interesting counter to the Lakers defense, rebounding, and dominant interior scoring.
the fakest superteam of washed players since lakers with Kobe Nash Dwight Gasol
If you're the Nets, how do you even defend your atrocious performance tonight, losing to the Lakers' B- and C-squad? Oh right, the Nets don't defend.
Lakers missing 3/4 top players, crazy they’re even close to .500 during this stretch.
Best dub of the year no doubt
I was expecting a blowout but I was still surprised
THIS IS THE WAY!!!
I am so happy lets gooo
Um, lol
Lol
THUNDER CRACKLING / THOR LIGHTNING EYES
AD the highest scorer on the lakers once again. smh hes carrying bron
Anyone playing defense want to get bought out by the Nets??
*This* is the team that's supposed to beat the Sixers and/or Bucks in a 7 game series?

Lol
I didn't watch the game but can anyone explain how did the Nets got blown out by the Lakers who didn't have AD and Lebron? Only Harden is missing
Heat in 6
NBA Twitter was in shambles
Nets have one of the best offense of all time with their stars but who is going to defend at the center position? Drummond feasted in 20 mins and Embiid and Giannis are going to cause way more problems. Might not be as easy route to the finals for the nets as people think
The Lakers looks good even without LBJ and Davis frankly. Despite what everyone said about how doomed the team would be without those two they are actually pretty good. When LBJ and AD will come back they will be pretty much head and shoulders above anyone else, as it was at the beginning of the season. The newcomers are way more fictional than what Brooklyn did, which at this point is a complete mess. They will win some just because of the sheer talent they had, but I wouldn't be surprised to se some upset in the PO.
LAKERS
Honestly was never a fan of Drummond, I tried to start following the Pistons but his lack of basketball IQ drove me insane (watched so many guards just pop behind him for easy layups). That being said.... What a pick up for the Lakers. All he has to do is snag rebounds. LeBron and Davis got the rest. Sorry Marc Gasol.
Nets working hard hard to get Harden that MVP trophy huh?
Skiuuuup!
woah. stick drummond on a good team and he performs better
I hate these games where really good teams can’t play their best players. Injuries sure do suck. Seeing James and Davis smack the shit out of Harden, Irving, and Durant would have been a sight to see.
You guys sleeping on Laker legends Drummond and McLemore
You're telling me the Lakers beat the nets and they didn't even play LeBron or AD? Lol LAKERS REPEAT THEN
Kevin "easy-road" Durant struggles to take down the Bald Mamba and sidekick THT
The lakers just smacked the Nets without LeBron OR AD? What in the fuck
are the nets gonna be last year’s clippers ?
Defense wins championships.
Nobody hates the NBA more than the NBA
[deleted]
Can't wait to see all the nephews say how this wouldn't have happened if the Nets were all healthy and Kyrie didn't get ejected
Lakers offense last couple games has looked better and better. Reminds me of last year
Lakers are scary when they regain full force
That’s tuff
Please remind me how this nets team is it's no defence is gonna sweep the East
Incredible win by the Lakers. Their defense is already insane, AD Lebron back with Drummond is gonna replicate last year’s defense.
[deleted]
Imagine a healthy frontcourt of AD, LBJ, Drummond. It's over man
Nets fans have to wake up and realize that no team ranking in the bottom ten defensively has ever won a championship. Most championship winners have a defense in the top 10. Even the 2011 Mavs were in the top 10. Even healthy with their full roster, there is literally no way, zero, for the Nets to win this championship. I don't even see how they can win a best of 7 vs the Sixers. They don't have the muscle down low, they don't have the intensity on the perimeter, they just have 3 high volume scorers, one of which is an amazing passer, and one good spot up shooter when open. That's it. The final this year will be Lakers vs Philly.
what the hell happened
I want to see both teams all healthy
The Nets need to go get Embiid and Steph in the buyout market asap
Regardless of whether we were going to win, the double ejection sucked the wind out of the game
This was probably the most important game of Nash’s Career as a coach. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. If that happens what are you going to do adjust to the situation and can you bounce back?

After a game like this is when a coach needs to say something so the entire team doesn’t fall apart. 

On the the side though this shows that this lakers squad is good. Even without Lebron and AD. They had 50% shooting tonight and 55% from the 3. So a pretty good game. 

Nets shot 43% from the field and 18.5% from the 3. That’s the biggest example of why defense is more important than offense in the playoffs.

They weren’t able to keep it close or dig out of the hole they were in. 

In the 2nd half lakers shot better and nets defense wasn’t good enough to counter that.
GET FUCKED
This was actually really fun until refs got involved and changed the flow of the game. I know hot takes are gonna fly and I enjoyed the win, but Nets vs Lakers just looks like a ton of high quality offense vs defense fun that I hope we get to see in the finals. GG Nets, you guys are gonna be giving everyone a heart attack each game.
Well I mean obviously a Lakers/Nets game without AD and Lebron would result in a blowout, what did everyone else expect?
#hahahahahahahaha
I'm glad I didn't put any money on this game.  Lakers G-leaguers summoning their inner Steph Curry with the 3's and holding Durant to 22 points in Brooklyn; would not expect to see any of that in my crystal ball. 

I would have thought Brooklyn would blow out the Lakers or any west team in a best of 7, but now I have doubts even though it's just one game.  This will be an interesting matchup if both these teams are healthy and make it to the finals.
Ben M was sneaky good signing. Fits well in this Laker squad
I was told defense doesn't matter.

Apparently, the Nets won by a whooping minus 25 because defense doesn't matter.
This is why Harden is by far the Nets most valuable player.
Megatrap game
Inspiring win tonight by the Lakers. They look amazing out there. When the rest of the team comes back, they would seem unstoppable.
Drummond changes this team completely without AD and LeBron
yessir we take those

nets pack hitttinnnnnnn
Embiid going to eat if 76ers match up gainst the Nets.
Lol
Can’t wait to watch Skip try and spin this
Andre Drummond: having flashbacks to his days as a Cavalier when they would own the Nets.
Good to see Drummond getting love. As a cavs fan the Drummond slander kind of bothered me. Dude carried us to some wins earlier in the season and doesn’t get enough credit. 

Yes he takes some bad shots but any fan that tells you he’s a net negative doesn’t understand basketball imo. When he plays to his strengths he’s really good.
Dafaq
I would hope your team would win shooting well above 50% on 34 3 point shots.  Lakers defense was stellar as well.
This one goes out to Bill Simmons and Ryen Russilo for claiming that buyout players don't make any difference.
Lakers are having some bad mood swings
I expected a blowout 

I got a blowout 

I guess lol
Atlanta hawks flashbacks, get kd more help.
SMOKING THAT KYRIE PACK AND THIS SHIT IS HITTING
Thank you Lakers, very cool!
Nets getting dumpstered in the finals.  Nice try big 3 or 5 or whatever.
Pretty bad performance there, Nets.
So Nets cant even beat Lakers without Lebron and AD? Thats just sad.
Nash is a deer in headlights. We're fucked if we need actual coaching to win games. Hope the players down the stretch figure it out, cause he will not.
This will be a completely reasonable and thought provoking thread
Nets are a fake ass team. Everyone dick riding then but they're so trash they lost to us without bron AD or Kuz

Edit: Didn't just lose, got beat down.
So what superstar is asking for a buyout next? How much help do the Nets need?
If they meet in the Finals, the Lakers will just have to bench AD and Lebron, there’s no need to play them.
Great game from Alfonzo McKinnie!

10 points, 9 boards, 4 assists in 27 minutes with zero turnovers and +17.  Other than oh-for-2 at the line, you cannot ask any more than that from your \~13th man.  Had 3 offensive rebounds, and kept a couple more alive, and was noticeable in a good way all night.
I fucking love this team
SCRAY HOURS 😤😤😤
The nets are possibly good enough to get thru the east but they are not good enough to beat any of the top 5 in the west
Yikes.. Complete domination and a blowout. Lakers had a 20+ point lead most of the game. No LeBron, or AD.. Not even Kuzma

>

 Just give Durant, Kyrie and that Nets team some MORE All Stars and Superstars. Just Harden, Blake Griffin and Aldridge is not enough


Maybe some more superstars for the 2nd unit. 


>

Otherwise.. Kyrie might start doing meth soon, if he isn't already.  And Durant will find more random kids on the internet to argue with, like some insecure man child
Didn't think I would say this today,but gg EZ.
Drummond feasted.
Dribble brothers, mario brothers, storm weather

Lakers in 5
I lost a lot of money on this. Glad the Nets enjoyed their light workout session, because they did not show up to play basketball tonight. No defense, no heart, crap attitude.
8 players with 10+ points. That's championship ball
Refs are soft man if players are arguing let them argue the moment it becomes physical then call the tech, it's ruining the regular season competitiveness
I know no Harden but this Nets team losing against underdogs like Cleveland and Bron/AD less Lakers isn't a good look.

And LA's top scorers were guys they picked up from the waiver wire too
Nets are still the biggest threat to lakers from the east. If anything this game is a memo to all teams in the east, prop up your defenses and you can have a shot at taking down nets. Embiid and simmons are going to give them a tough time
Time to hide until playoffs. Can someone link to when the nets had a super small lead for 2 seconds and create that wormhole again. Thanks
Fun thread to look back on in a few months lol
LMAOOOOO this is an embarrassing lose by the nets ong
Yeah let's overreact!!
Hot take:   I can see the Heat taking out the Nets in the first round.
Fuck the Nets
Trap game for the Nets. Fuck the refs
Brooklyn what?
Harden for mvp
Cant win them all, I mentally checked out once Kyrie got ejected

Cant really make finals predictions when both teams are missing so many essential players


Call this salt or coping but the recency bias of this sub is annoying, after every rare Nets blow out its "KD ruined the league again" but I'm sure after this game its "Nets are frauds". Very annoying to see tbh
[deleted]
Nets hate the 1st seed
Nets are garbage
This team goes nowhere without Harden
The fuck is going on...

I woke up expecting an absolute trouncing...

I mean it did happen, but by the Lakers??
Poor Nets, should have signed Drummond too.
Drummond washed btw
When there's an ejection, injuries and minutes limitations there's a disappointing game
LMAO @ all the hot takes here. Lakers shot 56% from 3. Even when LBJ-AD returns, they wont shoot 56% in a whole series.
This why I think Harden should be in MVP convo
Lmfao mfs love overreacting. 

Nets beat Lakers earlier in the season and we overreacted then

Lakers beat nets now, we overreact again
and here come all the arrogant laker fans out of the woodwork
[deleted]
lmao

thank you for keeping the 5th seed, baby lakers
Typical trap game. I've lost my fair share of bets on these types of games. Nets at -11 with the Lbj and AD less Lakers on the fifth game of a road trip with the Nets on three days rest on the third game of a three game homestand with KD and Kyrie playing?
Can lakers fans stop pretending Lebrons supporting cast is trash in order to prop up his MVP case now?

This team is stupid good.
Harden MVP case
Harden is the MVP / the nets run through him
[deleted]
Lakers didn't fall for the trap game
They really gave prime THT Ben Mclemore
Who gave this gold lol
Just as everyone expected. GG  Nets
LET THE GAMES BEGIN!
https://youtu.be/WCxzEm6nyqI
Yessir best win of the season man
About Lebrons DPOY case....
Our defense is still insanely good even without our 2 best defenders
Davis out at least 2 more weeks and Lebron 3 weeks. How will Lakers do in 3 weeks?
As we all expected.
Gg ez
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love basketball
thunderstorm coming.
Bum ass nets bums ass blake bum ass lma 😂
Are current Lakers as constructed better than the Kobe Shaq Lakers?
entire slate was one sided games. surely one of them had to upset.
Nets were fire from three. /s
An absolutely great win for the Lakers!
This team > 2017 warriors
I just wanna say when LeBron went down y’all said Lakers in danger of missing the playoffs and here we are :)
No defense, big problem.
Drummond and Aldridge putting good work? What year is this??
I’m excited for Stephen A’s take on this lmao
nets is just hopeless without the real mvp james harden.
And I was hoping the Lakers would fall to the 7-8 seed, not gonna happen now.
Is this real life
How
Really fun game to watch from a lakers fan perspective
Lakers defense, even without AD, is very good
Where is Gasol on the player stats?
How?
Whaaaaaaat!?
LMAO
At this point, why is Aldridge starting over Claxton?
Always bizarre when Kyrie plays point guard and has 0 assist games.
Is there any video of when Schroeder actually got ejected? In the broadcast they were still showing a replay, curious to see if there’s footage of what actually happened in the moment
Wtf how did this happen?
I don't watch basketball, but I used to and it's crazy to me how much more scoring regularly happens in this day and age.  I remember a hundred point night was huge, now it's all the time and both teams are scoring that much
Le Ron fouls too much offensively
You don’t have a chance when you can’t make 3’s
Very good win for the lakers
LeBron has 5 rings. ThIs Nets team has 0 playoff wins.
This is embarrassing. I really thought we turned a corner.
I miss Bron and AD so much.
Vogel refusing to play Gasol is really pissing me off.
Thank god the Mavs are gonna lose tonight.
Thoroughly enjoyed the game! Cannot wait for the next round
Clarkson is likely the runaway 6th man of the year but he shouldnt be. Inefficient scoring off the bench is not as valuable as it’s treated for that award. He’s not even shooting league average in terms of TS and his turnover to assist ratio sucks especially for a guard.
Now lakers fans can stop crying when people say lakers are a superteam
[deleted]
Harden is the MVP. Without Harden this team isn't the dominating wrecking ball anymore, back to just being a good team
I never quite understood the hate for Lakers fans until this thread lmao
That was shocking but when you think about it with no harden, kyrie ejected and KD on 20 mins restriction it’s no surprise they lost even with Lakers missing their best 3 guys
Laker fans question 
Is this team better without kuz?
Can’t wait for the hot take artists to blame Harden for this loss.
Can’t wait for ESPN talking heads to overreact to this for weeks
[deleted]
So NBA is fixed now 
Damn can’t wait for The playoff
I still believe in the Nets to win it all and a team like New Orleans to shock LA.  Too much talent in the West, those teams are going to kill each other.  So come Finals time, whoever comes out of the West will be in rough shape.  Suns, Nuggets and Clippers are all very chippy teams that will leave a dent.
And 1!
Haha I commented during our most recent game “you know it’s over when they put Giannis’ little brother in”
And an assist!
Gonna need another top 10 player to deal with Kostas
Better in 2 minutes than Blake Griffin in 16
The only champion in the Antetekounmpo family
Giannis to the Lakers confirmed.
I checked bleacher report at the point when he had 3 points in 0 minutes lol.
Legit thought kostas koufos was on a team for a minute
Fun Fact: Andre Drummond only needs 9 toenails to beat the Nets.
He’s a fantastic pick up for them.
4/6 free throws! Look out, nba
Is that good?

Is 20 and 11 good? I need someone to tell me if that's good

Was he efficient enough? Lolol
My buddy put $50 on the Lakers winning by 21+ and the mad man won $5k. Wild, he’s not even a Lakers fan.
McLemore just gave the Lakers enough of that pure Morey-ball energy to offset some of that Lakers shooting curse. 

Dude was cold during the first three quarters but then became Morey’s ideal role player by hitting 4 straight threes at the 4th. Q. I feel like he’s gonna be Bron’s new Jr Smith with the ultra green light beyond the arc. Lol.
Mclemore is the obviously the best acquisition from Houston that any team has gotten this year, but who’s second?
I don't get how you sign him and he travels and plays immediately and the sixers sign people and they don't play for 3 weeks.
Basketball treasons
Fun fact: LeBron has never won a title without a Jayhawk his team. Now he has two.
my reaction after Dennis started off 6 for 6
Imagine Embiid on them ... wew
Dear God I can't wait to see what this looks like fully healthy.
Yeah,  people were giving me shit when I said Drummond + AD were a major problem for the Nets.  I remember what the cavs did to them those first couple games
So Shaq ?
Drummond, vucevic, and Kanter gave been net killers their whole career. You can't really extrapolate their performances to other players. But yea Davis will be a problem.
Not really AD just shoots and doesn't post up in the paint much
Scared of the hornets in round 2
Nets looked pathetic
I love basketball
I'm so sick and tired of these super teams ruining the league. I mean, how is the rest of the league supposed to compete against a lineup that has Talen Horton-Tucker, Alfonzo McKinnie, and Ben McLemore on the same team? It's just not fair.
Lakers sweep nets in finals
At least you’re honest. Good ass game though. Solid bench team that’s gonna make the west very interesting
WE GONNA BE SHAMPIONSHIP
Reporting for duty
Drummond's missing toenail signs with the Nets and gets FMVP
finally a good take

GGs regardless
Here for it baby boy (or girl)
Caruso finals MVP prediction gang
Lakers still have a better all star starting 5 than the nets.
Nets not getting out of the East
its not an overreaction to call Drummond and absolute steal for LAL

nor is it an overreaction to note that LAL remain the clear favorites for the title

hopefully Commish can at least toss a bit of good fortune back to CLE in the lottery.  CLE cleared LAL's cap so they could sign LeBron and handed them a piece that will help them get another title this year.  should be worth something to the league.
Both ways lmao
Vogel's been the 3rd star all along
this dude can coach defense holy shit
It’s kinda stupid how no one gets lost that much on D with the number of switches that they do. Every time KD got doubled crossing the halfcourt, the Lakers just knew where KD was gonna lackadaisically pass it. Lakers just abused the Nets by forcing so many live ball TOs. 

Lakers D is truly elite. Great communication, good length, good athleticism, good effort, and great gameplanning. Vogel aint a one trick pony with his defensive sets. Scary how he still has two superstars who are both super switchable on D up on his sleeve...
And to think he was the Lakers' *third* choice for coach. Unreal.
Still can’t get over people calling Rob a failure for not getting Monty Williams or Tye Lue lol
I think he has to be in the conversation for best defensive coach in the league
I’m starting to actually think Vogel is a top 5 coach in the league...
people were hating on starting drummond at the 5 but vogel is smart and knows dre just wants to put up these double double nights and needs to get going. I actually really loved that starting lineup, frank should be looking at that 5 in certain sets down the stretch
Number 1 defense in the league even while AD and LeBron are out and he's dishing out Benny Mac and McKinnie to defend. Love it.
Yes he is ... \*sheds single tear*
Best Lakers coach since Riley?
I am still surprised Aldridge didn't end up with Miami

Maybe not on defense, but on offense he absolutely looks like he has a lot to give still
All that firepower to get blown out by Ben McLemore
Undisputed gonna be amazing on Monday lol
It's *The Ciy of Brooklyn Buyout Bowl Brought to You by Wish^TM*
ben mclemore
I think we did when we beat the Kings last time
No
Really kind of stupid that the Lakers have been cruising near .500 a bit while AD and Bron are out. Huge come playoff time

...Mr. Wayne
Not gonna happen but I hope Vogel gets some serious look as COTY, AD will be out 8+ weeks, shuffling Lebron out 4+ weeks, Gasol missing 10+ games and the Lakers still have the #1 defense by Defensive Rating. Phenomenal
I don’t know why everyone’s been downplaying Lakers like we are full of bums after Lebrow. 

This team is legit insanely deep and built for playoffs
The Nets won this game with Harden, Lakers win this series with LeBron and AD
People don't understand how good this Lakers team is or was last year. They need to repeat to cement themselves.
Win with Harden? I dont understand the qualifier.  What if the Lakers have Lebron & AD? Theyre all out for injuries. The Nets had Kyrie and KD today
But can you imagine, Lakers miss LeBron, AD and Kuzma (Who has been phenomenal on D) while Nets only miss Harden, I think even with Harden, it would have been a close one tonight
Actually, you know Lakers will lose if you see bricks from their shooters, especially in 1st qtr. Now with Drummond and McLemore, I think they already found the solution. Shooters won't be shy shooting because you have a solid rebounder in Drummond. McLemore fill the gap if Matthews, KCP, and others are struggling. In today's win, McKinnie found another good asset, like how they discover THT. Looking forward for more minutes for him.
Hard to say because I why even say “if harden was there” when the lakers are missing basically their entire starting lineup on top of their two stars.
>although nets probably win with harden

Lakers probably win with LeBron and AD.
they're #2 without LeBron actually giving that much effort on defense too

when he cranks it up in the postseason... well, they win another title.
Imagine we don't have to do play-in and AD and Bron goes full healthy in the playoffs.
A measured take?

Where am I?
Agreed
This is the correct response.
Rooting for my team, but yeah, don’t wanna have any hot takes when the season isn’t even over and playoff season hasn’t started.
not just the wins but seeing roleplayers dial in their defensive roles in preparation for the playoffs. that's why the loss against miami was not too bad, the team played well
Am I really seeing someone with a level headed take on r/nba and not overreacting to one game. Man, I have seen it all I guess.
my thoughts as well, but the defense is still impressive against the best offense in the league — to be a little ahead of them until kyrie/schroder ejections is really good in and of itself
Based
Alot different than when all those draft picks. And people were mad when we traded for Davis
Thing is , we really needed this win to stay in playoff contention. Shit is crazy in the west right now.
A reasonable take from a Lakers fan. Don't know about the rest though.
The spiciest of takes. I'm here for it.
If he continues to influence the Lakers into shooting average~good, yikes
Dudes shot was wet AF
His form gave me some really strong Ray Allen vibes. A little bit more loose but the 2 motion form had me thinking.
In the loony bin where they belong
Yo that kid is special. Do not trade a kid who can play playoff minutes at his age.
That was the idiots anyways
I'll trade one THT for Bradley Beal please.
It wasn’t even just him, that’s what makes it even dumber. Trade 3 rotation players for Lowry? Come on.
he was 4/16 bruh
Drummond is 3-0 against the Nets. One of those wins was against a fully healthy nets squad too
Imagine what Embiid and Giannis are going to look like..
I’ll be rooting for y’all to take em out in the playoffs.
You're welcome
Or Dennis for half the game
A bunch of our losses have come against teams we should have throttled.
Dudley?
[deleted]
No Wes is a good thing for the lakers tho
It wasn't all that long ago many people posted how they wanted Gasol and Wes off the team. NBA fandom is a fickle thing.
Matthews is pretty washed doe...
yes against a nets team with no harden kd or kyrie
Harden is the most important player in any team that doesn’t have LeBron and Giannis.
Anyone watching the games knows this 100% is true lol

They were one game below .500 or at it before Harden and he carried without KD and without Kyrie sometimes to the first seed. 

Some people in the Nets sub are still delusional and saying KD is more important smh
Just watching this game, I think the biggest issue the Nets are going to face is that Kyrie is gonna get targeted on the defensive end. The Nets will be forced to help for him, opening up shots on the perimeter.
Everyone that watches Nets games knows this, Harden is 100% the most important player without a doubt
KD and Kyrie can get theirs, but when Harden plays all of Brooklyn's roleplayers eat.
Wrong.  Look at how the Lakers adjusted to him in the playoffs last year.  Half court fuck around.  Run down the clock and force shit shots by a good shooting team.  Have we forgot about that game where the rockets scored the 4th most 3pts in history and still got spanked
Spot on about THT. He's starting to pass more and good things happen when he does. When he stops forcing things it all flows so much better. His game definitely changed after this years preseason hype.
Ben just got signed man give him a break lmao
Vogel is an amazing defensive coach going back to his Indiana days
Sometimes THT gets a tunnel vision when driving but aggression is nice I suppose.
so glad we didn't trade for Lowry
Yea, as a Nets fan that's one thing I noticed. Lakers rotations are much quicker than Nets' rotations despite both running switch-heavy defenses. It was very effective at taking out shooters like Harris which really hurt Nets' offensive spacing.
Only problem with THT is that he can be very predictable at times and become a one-trick pony. This is definitely going to improve over time though with how young he is. Definitely will be a big piece down the years for sure.
Ben just doesn't know all the plays yet, he just signed.
>it's when he decides from the stsrt i'm gonna score, that's a problem

He seems to not have a Plan B for when his attack moves don't go as expected. Great facilitator but when he tries to score, gets tunnel vision.
Please destroy them in the playoffs
I can't wait to see Embiid destroy their nonexistent interior defense in the playoffs.
LeBron and AD were holding us back. Kuz moreso. Jk come back soon pls
Lebron and AD coming back to this supporting cast... feels bad for who ever has to face this in the first round
Yeah people keep acting like it’s a one for one. Even Rachel Nichols did that on the podcast - insinuating that the trade was really just THT for Lowry. All three of those guys contribute so much to our team. And what would happen if Lowry got injured? We’d be so fucked
Man, if that trade went through, and Lowry’s injuries still happened , Lakers legit would probably be on a 10-15 game losing streak.
Are you telling me trading your entire guard rotation for a 35 year old Kyle Lowry is a bad idea?
People were mad at Rob for keeping them lmao
and lowrys fat ass is injured
Lowry is also injured right now...
I wasn't a fan of the trade proposal. If Lowry gets injured/ejected then they are done. It's too much exchange for one vet
One of the dumbest circle jerks on this thread is believing the lakers should trade 2 starters and a good young player for 35 year old lowry. Dumb af
Because of a regular season game?
[deleted]
Lowry is not worth that sort of package. Raptor fans were very delusional.
The Lakers somehow keeping this thing together and not plummeting in the standings is an underrated storyline for the year. This team doesn't have Lebron or AD, the team has also been missing Schroeder, Gasol, Mathews, and Kuzma for games during this run without Lebron + AD.
They put them clamps on
KD cant win with these cats
We still have the 2nd best defense in the league
Defense.
We Tuff 🔥💯
We built different. And the threes helped a ton lol
Your team came to play defense, Nets didn’t have any interest in doing that.
Built different
Watch us lose to the Knicks and/or Charlotte now lol smh. We're a great defensive team but are inconsistent offensively. Though I think we've worked out some kinks recently and have shown we are better than what we had been showing without AD and Bron
We clapped and separated them cheeks like a different kind of red sea
We finally learned to shoot.
Defense
Frank Vogel vs a rookie coach.
You played against a weak Nets with their big 3 not there fully. Harden was out, Kyrie ejected early when the game was close, and KD was on minute restrictions.
Magic potion
Shot 55% from 3s on 34 attempts.
the team actually hit their shots.

turns out you win when you hit your shots and score more points than the opposition 👀
Brooklyn is for soft cats
Better team wins.
If Aldridge couldn’t contain drummmond who can’t finish, AD giving them hell
I had that thought many times too- If the real AD is shooting this shit, it's too easy

I also think vogel has a responsibility to work in gasol once he's healthy again and that'll be even worse for the Nets too, if he can drag out Claxton or Jordan to the outside while also being able to make plays for cutters
lebron is a lot easier to keep under control. harden can stop him very easily.
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Check Skips timeline lmfao hes getting the excuses ready
Skip back on the clippers bandwagon after that game.
On Monday:

Skip: The nets would have won if they had Kyries and Harden for the whole game

Shannon: But Skiiiiiip the Lakerandidnt have AD and LeBron

Skip: KD just  came back from injury 

Shannon: But Skiiiiiiip, the other day you said KD looks great like he next left and was ready to go

Skip: These guys have played few minutes together, harden KD and kyries haven't been together on the floor much

And so forth
And Nick going at Brandon.
[Skip’s reaction](https://youtu.be/kqqD2c8X1xQ)
He's probably already going in on instagram or facebook.
I don't really get it, I don't look at their roster and feel like any one player is such a bad defender

Maybe I don't watch enough Nets, but it seems like they have a bunch of average defenders

I do feel it is the system, actually, that isn't really elevating the players or even fitting them together on defense

If you think about it, Claxton + Durant should be able to be quite good on defense. I also think Irving and Harden have improved to be usable at worst now.
They outscore people and don't defend at all. They also aren't a very physical team. That won't work against us.
They're kind of useless without Harden lol. Playmaking is a real struggle without one of Harden/Dinwiddie in addition to Kyrie. Kyrie is a decent playmaker, but he's always been more of a shooting guard anwaysy.
And when Claxton was out there we just switched a guard onto him and feasted...
Defensively they are #25 this season, and they act like they're championship contenders. Bunch of clowns. The Sixers are going to spank them so hard in the semis.
found carti's alt
KC3, D3nnis Schro3d3r
THT need the ball in his hand to be as effective as he is now.
This sub doesn’t know shit.
Nets made Drummond look like Shaq.
We keep getting knocked off the villian role. First clippers last year, now nets
After 2020 are we even shocked at anything anymore?
Whatever makes u sleep well at night cuh
As soon as kyrie got ejected KD had to play make, quick 5 turnovers in less than 10 min lmao
Facts
He needs all star teams just to compete
Is it time to be legitamatly concerned about Kevin Durant?
14 hours later, only 1.7k. Typical.
You mean KD is on the phone asking to join the Lakers. He's loves joining teams that tap that ass. Surprised he's not in Toronto tbh.
This is the plan for the east. The Bucks can take the nets to 7 and absolutely punish their defense and keep up with their offense. 

If i have my choice I would rather take my chances with the Sixers in second round. 

If nets get the 2nd seed their 2nd round will be alot more difficult.
wait for sixers
Watch the Knicks smack us lol. They play a lot harder and play defense though.
Every team bar the 2016 Cavs has been elite defensively going all the way back to the Heatles.
And healthy Lakers offense also happens to be elite.
he can average 14/11 just cleaning up scraps when this team is healthy
Whoa.. deja vù
They are, but Harden didn't play so.
Harden didn’t play. Kyrie got ejected. KD is on a minutes restriction.
Sure, you know if the whole team was playing.... Guess Laker role players are better this game than Nets role players.
That Sexton game was crazy
Lakers fan. Agree with your take and agree that those ejections were weak. That Sexton game was nuts.
I’m on the Nuggets hype train fr.
Not me. Anyone but Lakers
We were missing LeBron, AD, Kuz, Gasol, Matthews, Dudley, and Schroeder got ejected.
Think our toughest matchup is probably clippers
Denver may have a chance, especially with home court.
its unfair that they can just rest AD and Bron for months to get ready for the last few weeks of the season
Meh.

If both are healthy then I think Nets are still the toughest matchup.
This overreaction is crazy. An injured heat team took the Lakers to 6🤣
Calm down lol, Nets ain’t even playing Harden and Kyrie got ejected.

Those two are the system rn, especially Harden. Game was super close until Kyrie was ejected.
I agree with the last part, but the Nets are absolutely still the team to beat in the east, especially when the big 3 is in
reading this, makes me happy
**Evil Laughter Intensifies**
You fcking need meeee!
C team
Harden may be their most important player. KD is certainly the best overall talent but Harden’s skill set on offense really makes the team better.

Yeah, Drummond haters are in their shells staying very quiet right now. They were out in full force after Drummond’s Lakers debut where he got hurt in the 1st quarter. These people somehow cannot see that Drummond will help the Lakers, especially next to LBJ/AD, and it blows my mind.
>  But really we were keeping it close even with Kyrie in...

Technically the Nets were keeping it close -- the Lakers led for all but a few minutes pre-ejections, and were up 10+ more than they trailed.
Exactly, Harden IS the offense lol

They were below .500 with KD and Kyrie, Harden gets here and carries a crazy win streak sweeping the west coast by himself mostly(kyrie was out a few of those games) with KD out completely and Kyrie missing a significant amount of games. He's clearly at minimum the MVP of the Nets. People will stay disrespecting him tho
Schroeder waved Kyrie off after his ejection hence the 2nd tech.
It's actually wild, kyrie and kd didn't even scare me much but you add harden and they're a nightmare matchup. Ik he tends to get shit for some of his playoff performances but his ability to demand consistent double teams, and his otherworldly play making skills is just insane
Now imagine the open shots he’ll get with LeBron
This really would've been a Dudley cardio game if he was healthy.


Crazy.
Don’t worry he’ll find a way
Top defense and top 2 without him and Lebron
Kyrie deserved the ejection. Dennis did not.
Game ruined? I had a great time. Great game
Game won’t ruined for me. I enjoyed every minute of that shit.
Game wasn't ruined for me
How was the game ruined by the double ejection? 

KD, Aldridge and Griffin  was still there for the Nets. The Lakers while not as star studded still has Drummond, THT, Caruso.

Blame the Nets for their lackluster defense.
Seriously!  Refs took out both teams best ball handler/creators.  Game was pretty ugly from that point on.
Without their 3 best defensive players
Lakers also missing Kuzma lol
Kyrie was ejected at the beginning of the 2nd half and KD was on minute restrictions. So no it isn't so easy or obvious. Did you watch the game?
*Lethalgeles Lakers
[/r/Lakers mood](https://media.tenor.com/images/8b371e5406316a070838adf8c0aeb105/tenor.gif)
Neither did we
Get your umbrellas out folks!
The Nets didn't have their A team either for most of the game...
I don’t watch those Fox shows, so I’m curious has Marshall got called out for being flat out wrong about NBA contracts yet?
you misspelled “every day”
Dude the Nets would be unstoppable if they had LBJ and AD
Well the nets actually beat the lakers last year with lbj and ad with just kyrie. No need to imagine.
He is due
The only thing that people love hating on more than the lakers is this nets team
Imagine when Harden, Kyrie, and healthy unrestricted KD come back at their best come playoff time.
Oh look another delusional Laker fan with a hot take based on one regular season game.  Tell us something we don't know.
Didn't need to zing Harrell there at the end. 😂
Offense wins games, Defense wins championships.

We gotta figure out the defense
Nah Harrell can get his own, he just doesn't play well without his headband.
Trez actually has a damn good face up game, he just didn’t play well tonight.
This is why we didn’t trade for Kyle Lowry lol look at these guys ball together!
Two techs each and they go out is fair. I dont think people understand that Refs are trying to stop a fight starting to happen cuz that aint "competitive banter". If it was competitve banter, they wouldve stopped after the first warning and cooled off. But they decided to follow each other to the other side of the court.  

Some of the nephews I see are dumb honestly. Ive seen a couple of players getting pushed for no reason and continuously are being assholes by locking arms and pulling other stuff and I see here "Oh they're just having fun". You look at their face and they're not amused.
That ejection was weak, you clearly have only watched bball since 2010 or later. Is nephew an insult? A lot of people have uncles...
Ok so you should stop calling them that. Should they win the championship at full strength, you're all going to agree that they were just a normal better team than the rest of the league? Or are you going to flip flop?
Need the fucking refs to stay out of it
7 games of this would be amazing.
GG, hope both teams are healthy moving forward
Bit cocky that.
Agreed. Looking forward to LA/Philly.
embarrassing doesnt even explain it.
We started off 0-3 but the defense was always there. Now we are seeing the ball movement which is also creating better looks from 3. This bodes well for the team in the long run once our superstars are back.
Really? Why
That's probably Claxton will probably be the main go to with LMA coming off the bench.
lakers deep as fuck defensively. it's scary.
Ruined the game honestly. Rest of the game was dogwater
Oh c’mon now.
They haven't even been to the playoffs yet...and it's year one.
Kuzma too...probably their 4th/5th best guy
Didn't you get beat by the Grizzlies and Pelicans? lmao
It turns out signing a bunch of old washed up former all stars who wants to flex on their former last place team don't really improve anything when skilled teams come to play
Durant was on a minutes restriction and Irving got ejected
Nets have beaten these teams before. They get their top 3 players playing together and they will be able to shoot from anywhere.
Yeah, that's the other side of the coin of the Aldridge signing. When he scores it's fine and dandy but the man can't really play defense these days, a far cry from 2018.
Beginning of the season was an easy schedule for the Lakers lol. Lakers have to worry about atleast 4 teams on their end that wasn't there last season to get out of the West.
We can only hope, God it would be wonderfully just for that to happen to KD.
Not to be pedantic, but the Nets did pull ahead in the second quarter.
Kyrie was so salt filled and emotional
THT is crazy man. this kid
Because they have insane offensive talent especially when their best floor general plays
Stay wherever you are
This is the hockey copypasta right?
Harden changes this team 100%. Kyrie/KD is just iso.
Wow nice perspective. Willing to list some exceptions outside top 10 that eventually won? Just curious.
The Sixers dont have the heart to win yet. Bucks maybe
No team has had 3 superstars either. Nets D has been ranked about 14th for a few months low. Sixers have a chance but scoring will be a problem for them. Lakers are still team to beat until proven otherwise but they have a tough road ahead
Lakers shot out of this world for them.
Lakers either slump from 3 or they are on fire all game.
U trolling or na
Wanna know what’s more important then everything you just said? Being healthy!
anyone taking Matthews minutes is going to be a plus
3-0 against the Nets. Beast Drummond.
Relax bro
Should it be? Ya’ll got embarrassed by a hobbled team lol but whatever makes you new fans feel better
So then don't call them a superteam when the time comes?
They also beat the Lakers with lebron with no KD when AD were out...funny how you forget that so easily
laker fans really celebrating a regular season win like it's the finals
Is Kyle Lowry still available?
So perhaps you should stop calling them a superteam then? They beatable right? Or are you still scared knowing this wasn't a full Nets team playing?
When Lakers fans get cocky over a regular season game... and that's why Lakers fans are the most hated.
I guess you forgot they literally ran through the West with most of the games not having KD in them a few weeks back? It's all a matter of having all 3 back healthy or atleast 2 out of 3 playing at any given time.
Lol nets ran through the west trip with no KD
21-6 against teams above .500, 17-6 against Western Conference teams.
same team that says "its just the regular season" when they lose to detroit twice with a healthy LeBron
Kyrie's going to maybe take some time off
When have they play defense though
Just wait until we get Marc gasol back 😤
There’s so many of these dumb comments lol we should not have won this game and we blew you guys out, of course there’s gonna be some over celebrating
Nah
Surprise surprise people like hating on the team stacked with superstars who bailed on their previous franchises. Fans of major market teams are so out of touch lol
You mentally checked out when you saw you guys were getting blown out lol but whatever makes you feel better
That’s even worse because Kyrie is the one who started the altercation not Dennis.
Schroeder is literally the only ball handler on the Lakers with Lebron out.
Irving better than Schroder? What a blazing hot take honestly bro
Agreed. Especially because Kyrie was the Nets playmaker and KD was on minute restrictions.
Their stat lines for this game look pretty even to me.
Thanks Wizards fan....
Ehhh it's not due to a lack of Harden that made them lose. You probably didn't watch the game.
LMAO at all the haters here. When LBJ-AD returns, we won’t need to shoot 56% from 3
Can't quit on one team to go to a 'superteam' and win mvp. Regardless of how much Kyrie and KD have been out.
You don’t win MVP when you bitch out on your original team. Maybe next year though 🤷‍♂️
Nobody overreacted when you guys beat the Lakers without their stars. People are obviously going to overreact since KD and Kyrie played (more than half the game). That being said, it is just 1 game.
we went 0-4 during that stretch without bron and Dennis including Washington.
You beat us with no AD or Schröder. You know it’s not the same thing lol but okay
They've been missing their two stars and haven't gone on a winning streak in a minute. No need to be salty.
Time to overreact
And here come all the Laker haters mad that we’re celebrating an unexpected win
[it's been amazing actually.](https://twitter.com/__TheGREATEST1/status/1381074480651468807?s=20)
Don't go on it then
“Baby Lakers”? Lmao are you serious?
Here are teams who have gotten closer to a title than the Clippers (current)

The Bulls without Jordan, the Raptors without Kawhi, the Sixers without Moses, the Pistons without Wallace. The Lakers are coming from a championship in a complete equalizer environment where the Clippers blew a 3-1 lead in that same environment.

If the Lakers the baby team, then the Clippers need to be aborted.
Things look much better with a real center and getting Matthews out of the rotation for sure.
I mean they haven’t been particularly good, they’ve been okay against under .500 and bad with the occasional win like every other team against over .500 teams
Thank you
We gave up on his MVP case as soon as he went out. The role players are definitely not trash, but we’re not making the playoffs without our superstars so that’s not “stupid good”
Nah
Kyrie got ejected at the beginning of the 2nd half.
They are in great shape... winning half their games since they been out
Yes, honestly early 2000s was the worst talent wise the league was since 70s. In terms of contending teams.
He didnt play
Likeky a promise made to get him to sign
A super team would require 3 stars. They're just mad deep.
No ones crying buddy
People only wanna call us a superteam to try to delegitimize our championship. We have 2 superstars and good role players, like several other teams do
Youre a casual. Good role players doesnt equal 3 or 4 superstars
I would say you are easily more annoying simply based on your comment history
Because the watch all the games and have seen how bad these role players have looked at times
Cant be MVP when you abandon the franchise that catered to you to go to a superteam.
Lakers were without their best 4
Lol youre not wrong, downvotes are fun though.  

Plus its the regular season, its the same argument as lakers had last year losing to clippers.
[deleted]
Delete this bro
People said the same thing about the Clippers last year but then they got knocked out by Denver
he did that little shoulder shrug Giannis does afterwards, too. twas pretty cute.
Now that Thanasis is an actual role player, Kostas takes up the human victory cigar mantle.
1 reb as well. The classic triple single
Drummond seen chomping down carrots 3 at a time at halftime. Drug test incoming?
Big toe if true.
Agreed, it was a steal for the Lakers.
Everyone kept saying he was trash but he's exceeded or at least met expectations. Same thing with Aldridge.
Hes a fantastic pick up for anyone paying 1million dollar for a player of his caliber. Same with LMA.
A 30m player signing in super team for minimum lol ,you know its a great pickup. Buyouts are broken af
Defensively he's been suspect but he's been pretty good at everything else which is positive. Looks rejuvenated.
I was surprised I didnt hear the lakers got McLemore who also had a good game
I will always laugh at how much this sub flip flops on Drummond. Couldn’t imagine thinking this wasn’t a positive signing for them...just shows how stupid this sub can be
Let’s hold off on saying that lol
Wtf. Damn take him to a roulette table.
My buddy and I were watching and I got -9.5 during the 3rd and I was like, this is who is gonna play for the Lakers the rest of the game, the Nets may shut it down and bring backups in. We were right. Easy win. Only 100 bucks win off of 150, but still.
he got 100:1 on that?  that's like saying if the harden-less nets, a good but hardly otherworldly team, played an entire 82 game schedule against this lakers team, you wouldn't expect a single 21+ win for the lakers.  considering how often weird results happen, that seems crazy.
That is the dumbest bet I've ever heard someone place in basketball, absolute king
There will never be another J.R. Smith.
Has green light confidence + athleticism for lobs + can be decent on defense at times. Meets the JR requirements.
I remember there was some interest in signing McLemore by the Warriors back when the Kings waived him (alongside interest in Wes Matthews and Rodney Hood) because they were looking for a backup SG as the bench unit was atrocious at scoring, so they needed to stagger starter minutes w/ bench guys. Kinda wish we had signed him then.
Bron talked about McLemore when he was drafted. He loves his game.
He's got some dope flow too. Love to see it
Pj Tucker hasn’t committed any turnovers or missed any shots lately
I don't really get bucks games on tv here in LA, but I'd bet it's Tucker

that dude is awesome the way he controls the game so efficiently
Capela has been a real lob threat and rim protector.
He’s only the best because Austin rivers hasn’t got picked up. Just wait till he gets his chance to shine
It’s team policy that all new Sixers players have to sit out before they can play. Hinke started it and they’ve kept it ever since.
its nice to know dennis got that 6th man chip off his shoulder. he proved himself a starter and probably a nice paycheck come off season
I had a multi/parlay for lakers win + Dennis over 19.5... the lakers win alone was paying 5 to 1 so I got them both at 13 to 1.  Needless to say after that ejection I farted on my dog with rage.
lmao a healthy Embiid is averaging 35/15/3bl in a 6 game series vs this team
Don’t give them ideas... The Nets, on paper, are already too much.
The Nets have zero starting centers capable of playing even average NBA D, Davis will feast.
we'll see, playoff AD is more willing to bang bodies, but we might have another twin towers situation with AD + AD2.
Remember last year when everyone was asking why we weren't running AD/Bron PnR's, then in the playoffs we abused it and went like 4-1, 4-2 at most I think in everyone ensuing series because no team could guard both?  


We have that, plus a bang in the paint glass cleaner, and Bron, and energy off the bench and no more of the centers sit Rockets problems with Trez.
pshh not without lamelo they aint. I do love me some scary terry though. Almost always trade for him when I do a 2k sixers franchise lol
I only caught the 2nd half. The commentators were spot on. The Lakers seemed motivated by those ejections.
Was Harden the Key to all this?
lEtS hAnD tHeM tHe cHiP aLrEaDY!!! Lol
Against no AD and no Bron LMAO
As expected
You love to see it
i just want to know what denis said to kyrie
Come on man, let's not forget when the nets blew out the lakers without kd and lebron played that game in l.a.
Joe Harris shouldn’t even be in the WNBA.
Basketball is good.
I also love basketball. If u guys get out of the West, plz destroy the Nets, thanks.
Dude, me too.
He said overreact.
not an overreaction my dude, my guy, my friend
HEYY!! YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THIS
He said overreact
Frank Vogel is Frank Vogel's secret weapon
This is the way
The real star was the Vogels we made along the way...
Always has been
He must fume inside every time he’s asked about who the 3rd star is. NO RESPECT!
3rd?
His offensive schemes have gotten way better. He was lost on offense when LeBron went out but after 1 practice they started to get it going again.
Hes going to end his career as one of the greatest defensive coaches of all time without a doubt
That's always been well known. The Pacers were consistently a top defense in the league with him coaching PG/Hibbert

It was always his offensive schemes and timeout usage that sucked
Guy couldn't win shit in Indiana and NOW he can actually win big games
He put KCP on Durant to start the second half, and it worked
I mean that's part of the reason why they won the title last year. Having 2 superstars is great, but watching them also shut down their opponents was something else. They have a great squad for the post-season.
Even our 3rd best defensive player is out. Yes I'm referring to Kuz.
There's a reason why there's only been 1 rookie to get significant playing time on a Lebron team. A 24 year old Norris Cole I think it was.  Cant trust young players to be in sync on D like that
Vogel has one of the two best all nba defenders in street clothes and still maintaining a top defense. Shit is wild lol
Shows that the key to the defense these past two years has been Vogel, not AD or Lebron.
Two? I know Marc Gasol is one. Who’s the other?
We saw him really shine in the postseason man. Game 1's were just to study the opponent and see how they could react on defense for the rest of the series and it was a lock at that point.
Awesome defense. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got man. Wanna see how freakin' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation.
True but once Harden comes back you know he's gonna cut up any D like swiss cheese.
> good length

Not tonight really.  Drummond was the only Laker over 6'8", until Antetokounmpo played the last couple minutes.  There were times during this game when the three tallest players on the court were all Nets.
Last season it was drop coverage and verticality with our bigs Dwight and JaVale. This season the emphasis is more on perimeter defense. Kinda amazing how we haven't lost a beat defensively.
Never forget Ramona Shelbourne saying Rob doesnt understand the Trade Cap and is going to blow the deal for AD.
that entire offseason was a disaster. remember the fucking strike, lmao. or hearing about kurt rambis and his family non-stop. the leaks. all of it. seems like a distant memory now.
Please. Just by looks alone Vogel >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Lue


Even AD agrees
Monty is pretty dope too though
Remember Frank Vogel in Orlando?
Tbf Monty Williams is p much a lock for COTY. Vogel was still a great choice though.
It's between him and Thibs
And it isn’t close.
I really dont see him doing anything special
He can definitely coach defense
Had this conversation on here a few weeks ago and I was already advocating for it, but people didn't think he was at that level.
At the very least, up there for best defensive coach
Definitely is solidly in the running there, no doubt about it. Pop, Spoelstra,  and Carlisle are the only guys I'd say he's definitely behind, IMO.
He’s in my top 5 without question
It's a duopoly up in here
> Maybe not on defense, but on offense he absolutely looks like he has a lot to give still

With Jimmy as the leader and not accepting anything but everyone's best on that team, it's probably for the best that he didn't end up going there.
If the Nets needed defense and rebounding, why Blake and LMA who offer offense only?
“The Lakers were gifted a win! Irving was starting to turn the lead over and the Lakers were bailed out that he was ejected. The nets were missing the heart and soul of the team, James Harden. With him this game isn’t anywhere close!” - skip probably
I love how quickly he puts it up, no conscience whatsoever. All our other guys are so hesitant (besides Kuz whose just a meh shooter)
That quick release is nice
Fucking thrift shop curry wears your grandma's coat and hits 50% from 3.
Actually he hurt our numbers.. he shot 50% and we shot higher than that.
LeWeatherMan
LeQron James or LeBron Qames?
LeCapital
LeMeteorologist
No McLemore slander tonight!
The ice before the storm
Can't spell McLemore without Le
https://i.imgur.com/UMmSCLa.gifv
Lol he does get pretty hyped on the sidelines
Foul lol
Lol love it. I can understand what he was saying but I still think that massive lack of D will bite them later.
>Not gonna happen but I hope Vogel gets some serious look as COTY
 
We were #1 seed last season and he wasn't even Top 5 in COTY voting I believe.
He’s coached the best in the league this season in my opinion but you and I both know how they pick COTY
Makes you think Rob Pelinka should be getting Exec of the Year. Lakers kept their shit together without their stars for a prolonged period of time. Whereas Nets lose Harden and collapse like that (very reactionary take, I know).
Because they were...vs good defense, they tend to not do so well offensively without Lebron x AD because of their inconsistent 3pt shooting. Today they're blazing it on offense so I guess you just have to replace AD with AD lol.
Lol remember that clown Hollinger saying we had no one 3-8
To be fair, we have a brutal 10 game stretch and no team missing AD and Lebron will stack up well against elite playoff teams. Thats the only reason and its a fair one. As a fan, I would be thrilled with .500, until they come back, and believe in our boys enough for them to do that
Very true but also we had some bad losses while adjusting to not having bron, and the team we faced tonight dumped their bench for harden and then built maybe the most stacked bench in the league
You guys have two of last years top three 6MOTY candidates. Very funny how people think Lakers ain't deep.
Bron lovers do that to up his greatness
I mean the Nets didn't have a full strength team that Lakers won against. A Kyrie+Harden Nets already beat the Lakers before that had Lebron and gang - AD.
> This team is legit insanely deep and built for playoffs

They shot >50% from 3P, despite being a poor/mediocre 3P team. This team if they hit 3's looks much better, but the reality is they are inconsistent and their role players disappear often. When they show up, sure they look amazing.
Because that goes against the narrative the Lebron only carries bums to the finals.
Agreed. 

Lakers won by 25 with the end of their bench over Kyrie and KD. That's as big a statement win I can remember by a team playing without 3 of its starters.
Well Lakers win this game with Lebron and AD if Nets hypothetically have Hardwen.
That’s the thing, if these 2 are the Finals matchup—I trust Vogel and Kidd to make better adjustments than Nash in a 5-7 game series.
>Lakers win this series with LeBron and AD

I think that's impossible to predict. Did everyone suddenly forget how good the Nets are just because they played poorly one game?
And Kuzma, Mathews, and Gasol out lol
Chill bro friendly fire
Kyrie was ejected early and KD was on minute restriction. Obviously you didn't watch the game.
Kd on minute restriction and ky got ejected. Both teams were at weak strength. This game means absolutely nothing
That’s my fucking dream. Play-ins allow for too many variables, so I don’t want that risk. If we can finish the 6th seed or better I will be so happy.
TBH I’d rather face the Suns or Jazz in the first round rather than the Nuggets or Clippers. LBJ and AD might not be at 100% until the Conference Finals
WHAT YEAR IS IT?
Yeah, a game like this where both squads are missing key guys can be kinda fun, but you can't take anything really meaningful away from it. These teams might meet in the Finals but this sure wasn't any kind of Finals preview. Neither was the last Lakers-Nets game.
I mean, if we lost the whole place would have been “LeMickey” this and “bubble fraud” that or something... Lakers games get toxic as fuck lol
[deleted]
11 assists, 3 steals bruh. Kid can affect a game in many ways.
11 ast to 4 turnovers. 3 steals & good defense overall. 40% from 3. A steady ball handling presence when Schroder got hurt & then ejected. Great game for the 20 year old, even if he wasn't as efficient at the rim as he usually is.
I'll take that with 11 assists any day, the scoring will come but the kid can pass
Who said anything about a perfect game?
Drummond is the bane of soft teams. He made Nets bigs look like highschoolers.
thats why the nets know they need the 1st seed imagine going through giannis embiid and then lebron ad and ad lol
This guy knows the nets aren't making the finals.
Embiid will look like embiid because he’s always dominant.
They might average like 40/20 in that series and potentially still lose
Yep. The Nets just can't beat the Sixers in the playoffs.
This what I think of, I don’t think they make it out of the east because they won’t be able to do anything, unless KD does KD things.
Ehhh I’d rather play the Nets than the Sixers
Party like it's 1982
And Dennis was really on fire too!
Losing Kyrie hurt the Nets more than losing Dennis lol.
He's still a quality defender. His shot doesn't always fall but I can live with it because of the defense.
Ehh he's been excellent for his role since our two stars were out
Lately Wes has been great for the Lakers, actually.
and Jokic.
And steph
Hot take: Harden is also the best player on the team. He makes your role players look amazing.
As any great team will do. That's why them having a bad defense is a legitimate concern people have even if they are outscoring teams now. Playoffs always expose that type of stuff and one of the elite teams are going to attack him constantly. Another issue will be they can't deal with legitimate size so guys like Embiid, Jokic, AD, and maybe even Giannis will feast.
I still think a healthy Kd is most important. all of Brooklyn role players ate in their last game without harden, it’s just that this game they were down kyrie & Kd looks off the pace
4-14 this game though 🤷‍♂️
And he was godly tonight. Started 0/4 and finished 6/8 17 pts!
and he was very solid
I don't have the stats to back it up but it feels like he's missed a ton of dunks this year. I'm glad he's got confidence though
Really comes with being a young player. Kuz was exactly the same until this season where he starts to know how to read the defense more.

Not everybody will be a Lebron or Luka BBIQ right off the bat
He'll definitely get better at that as he gets more experience. He just turned 20 a couple months ago.
That and he’s got to improve his 3 pt shooting. I have high hopes for him though. He’s already becoming an effective player.
Say less
Its sad you need to put the jk cause I saw a comment seriously saying that earlier
Lakers in 4. 5 if LeBron and AD play.
Category 5 storm coming in 3 weeks. Hurricane GOAT.

And the West better board up....cause it won’t be safe to be outside.
Some ppl act like lebron isn’t the best playmaker in the league rn. Like he’s harden on the rockets where he just iso all the time and take 40 shots a game😂
Blessing in disguise
As much as I really want to see the Nuggets and Clippers have to play each other before they see the Lakers, I can't lie, I'd love to see the Lakers play the Clippers in the first round.
Jazz or Suns it appears to be
the whole ESPN is like of course you pull the trade for THT for Lowry....

and then ignore that fact Lakers needs to trade Dennis and KCP and get no guard after
Lowry did get injured. He's got a foot infection. :(
You mean you didn't want to see Alfonzo McKinnie play 25 minutes a game???
bruh the ESPN booth today were acting like it was a 1 for 1 and legit said they didnt know if there were more players involved lmfao
Not me. Rob deserves the benefit of the doubt after last season.
Shut up. Lowry is a baller
He has a “foot infection” dude
Yes sure, just like Siakam needing "rest" today lol
seriously lol, trade 3 guards for a HOF who apparently have been playing through injuries and are out since all star break

great thing we didn't pull the trigger
Vogel needs an apology
Well they have an under .500 record since James went out. They just had such a high seed to fall from that's given them a great cushion. It seems like forever ago but the Lakers were running away with the best record in the league before covid hit the team and Utah took over.
Eh, I’m not so sure. Excluding this game, they beat non-playoff teams they should have and lost to playoff contenders. They can easily lose the next four—NYK, CHA, BOS, UTA—and finish the month at 5-10 since Lebron’s injury.
It's a bit like how their 18-19 season was except this time with a competent coach.
KD can’t keep carrying this team. They need to trade for some more all-stars.
Likely will try to get more superstar help.
KD to the Lakers this offseason. The Hardest Road: Live Free or Road Hard
https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/defense/?sort=DEF_RATING&dir=-1 

Number 1? Even though our lead is less it's still 1!
Yes, but 5th best defense since Lebron went out.
that's tuff 🔥💯
>Nets didn’t have any interest in doing that.

Claxton did.  He might've been the only one, though.
For me personally the Nets are probably one of the worst defensive teams that I feel like is a title favorite if they are 100% healthy
lowkey is Steve Nash and Pringles coaching staff clueless on defense?
Dawg
It seems like they’ve finally figured something out without Bron and AD in the lineup. I also think the buyout bros have been a nice infusion into the team. Hitting shots also helps lol.
What is this comment? Lakers didn't have LeBron and AD and the best Lakers scorer after them was ejected with Kyrie while having the best performance in the game until that point.
Bruh we didn't have LeBron, AD, gasol, and Wesley Matthews. We were missing more players than the nets
Stupidest take I’ve seen. Time to schedule an appointment with neurology my man!
I didn't see Harden do that that last playoffs.
Uh what?
What?? I’m going to assume your missing the /s
Harden can't contain a fly
You from a parallel universe or something ?
Point me to one game where Harden locked up Lebron. Just one
"Rondo's Clippers" he says lol
I would say that Skip could get shamed in the playoffs if the Clips and Nets lose to the Lakers, but I'm not sure he is capable of feeling shame
He legit was getting ratiod by the # of comments hilarious
god i hope not, keep him away
their defenders are definitely average at best, unfortunately individual defense matters less than it used to, good team defense is adequate enough for a team of their offensive caliber
Durant doesn't give a fuck in defense. He only goes for contests when it's easy to do so. Otherwise he's just too scared to injure himself.
Coaching matters, MDA never coached defense, and Steve Nash never played defense in his career.
if we are focused and deandre isn’t playing our defence is decent. no one looked focused at all and kyrie being ejected kinda just killed the whole game for us
This was a bad game. Nets defense has been ok overall, pretty good with Claxton out there. Durant is still sorta coasting. LMA is terrible. Blake can only defend at the 5.
Yeah but how much effort do you think KD is going to put into defense this year?  I expect him to ramp it up when push comes to shove but this Nets team is obviously going all offense as their philosophy, they have the roster for it.  A Lakers-Nets finals would give us a good idea on whether offense or defense wins championships, Id be down for that
Durant defense is overrated
Nets defensive system is clogging the paint. Any team with good ball rotation can be a problem for their defense.
Not a single starter on their team is a plus defender. Irving is awful. Harden hasn't had interest in defending for years. Joe Harris isn't a good defender. KD has been one of the most overrated defenders ever since he was on the Warriors. KD is not a good on ball defender just uses his length to play good off ball D. LMA hasn't been a good defender for a few years. Griffin has never been a good defender.
They aren't particularly athletic or long and they don't have the full effort and buy in on every possession that teams like the lakers have. Also they've had a lot of people in and out of the lineup, no KD for a long time could partly be that. I think they have the makings to be about average as you said most of their defenders are. 2 points in def rating separate them (25th) and the 14th spot so a lot of the middle teams are really close together.
Good news for them Lebron is only like a top 5 finisher of all time im sure Jeff green can slow him down.
Reminds me of 2017 Cavs defense
It does seem like the nets weaknesses play right into Lakers strengths. Nets will outshoot LAL on a typical evening though
The next 2 best teams in the east are terrifying inside.
Sounds like a team that will get obliterated by the Sixers, Bucks, and Heat

Those 3 teams need to keep up with thei Nets’ scoring though
not to mention their switches don't work when you got drummond on p&r
I think the physicality is where you will see then wilt in the playoffs. The warriors had physicality even though they were an outside scoring team, they had tons of ball movement and their bench guys played excellent defense.

These Nets honestly looked soft compared to the Lakers - and that’s without Lebron and AD who would stomp them in the paint and splash from 3
there's no way you actually think it's going to be this easy right lmao
126 offensive rating without Harden lol. 4-2 in last 6 games without him. These hot takes are so nuts after Kd can’t play more than 20 minutes and Kyrie leaves early. Kd & kyrie centric offense & playmaking is fine but with the ejections and restrictions & rustiness is wasn’t the Nets night.
He’s still raw and has a lot to work on, it’s only up from him for here. I like watching him and Claxton
Lol you a nets fan and don't know he's on a minutes restriction and it's his second game back? lmao
You could go back way further. Mavs showed amazing team defense throughout their run. Spurs, Lakers and Celtics were all deep defensively. I think the 2006 Heat are the last team that wasn't truly annoying on defense. And the 2016 Cavs showed some amazing stretches of defense behind Lebron in the Finals. Those last 3 games you could not defend against a 73 win team any better.
Hello GOAT!
AD, Lebron, Kuz , Gasol, Wes didn’t play too so.
Almost like we were missing all our stars too
guess who else didn't play. humor me, make a guess
And Lakers didn’t have their two best players
Neither did kuzma so it evens out
And the Lakers don't have their stars so.
But the Lakers are missing way more?
That’s doesn’t mean anything. They still should have won this game easily, but they didn’t
Harden doesn’t fix those defensive holes.
the same way AD, LeBron, and Kuz didn't play with us also missing Schroder for half the game. no team is unbeatable aside from the 95 Bulls and the '17 Warriors
Could say the same for the Lakers not having AD, LeBron, Kuzma, Gasol, Matthews, etc.
A lot of players didn't play from both sides
Kyrie was also ejected
They are, but Deandre Jordan didnt play sooooooo
The guy who tweeted this originally also said "No excuses" before the game lmao
Shroeder got ejected. Kuzma, AD and Lebron out.
Yeah their stars were injured it wasn't fair.
No Bron, AD, Kuz, Wes Matthews, Gasol and Schroder got ejected stfu
Yeah, the Lakers aren’t missing any key players either...
Schroder was also ejected.

Oh, and I think Lebron and AD didn’t play as well.
[deleted]
It was, he just refused to go down and dragged us into double OT where we got murdered
Man I remember just sighing and laughing at the same time after that game.
If not us then Nuggets from the West or 76ers in the East for me.
yeah, if the lakers don't win it i'm hoping denver does
Oh for sure

But anyone but the Nets lol
Remember when the 2020 playoffs when the Lakers had what felt like a completely different lineup depending on the opponent? Feels like they're gearing up for that again. 

Losing AD and LeBron for this long might really not be the worst thing in the world for these guys. It's helpful to have to learn how to win without relying on James.
cmon u cant count wes or dudley lmao
Denver scares the shit out of me man. Gordon was such a great pickup for them. I pray someone takes them out first.
same here. Clippers defs improved at least mentality wise and they have a team that plays together. That and denver
Clippers look a lot better with Rondo at point guard. Hope they are for real and we actually get the Battle of LA this year
its the only team that would be trouble
As a Lakers fan I *really* want Lakers-Clippers in the first round (assuming everyone is healthy). I think the Lakers will stomp them, and I'd love to see the Clippers going home in the 1st round and really make Kawhi consider his choices this summer.
I got in the west: 

Nuggets
Clippers 

In the East: 

Sixers
Honestly I think the Nuggets match up pretty well with us
A few teams have a chance. I’d say you guys are the only ones favored though.
That was because of their defense and this Lakers team is better and more stacked
This take is almost as embarrassing as living in Texas.
Man I can’t believe I still keep seeing this dumb shit lol they won 2 very close games behind 2 godly performances from Jimmy Butler, the rest of the series was a blowout as it should have been
And lakers had schroder ejected, Kuz, Bron, AD, Wes, Gasol were not playing.

Nets only had Harden not playing and Kyrie getting ejected.

The Nets didnt have a close game, they got blown out. 

#NO EXCUSES
That’s really what did it? If so, that’s so fucking lame lol
Imagine the open shots he’ll get with ad and lebron
Dennis got ejected for getting mad at the ref for ejecting kyrie lol

Refs petty af
It honestly looked like Dennis was just chilling while Kyrie was yapping off
no one did tbh
KD is rusty and probably on a minutes restriction and griffin isnt good. I love how people assume he's good bc of his name and in reality he's a mediocre bench player. Once kyrie was ejected this game was over.
You can’t equate those groups of three players, which makes it all the more impressive the lakers won.
I understand they try to nip it in the bud to prevent fighting but a little leeway would be nice.
Wasn’t ugly for the Lakers. B Mac and KCP cooked the Nets.
Yeah I guess....I love seeing those airball free throws :D
Dennis also ejected.. No Gasol or Wes
You guys literally played against the South Bay Lakers lmfao
Hahaha
oof...need more salt in that wound tonight?
We beat the nets this year, we're clearly better than them like it's really not close. You think they can handle the combination of spicy p and Gary Trent Jr, cmon now
That's because they even *painted* their damn court to look like a super villain's team.
I think we all love hating on the Clippers too.
We will gladly go back to being most hated after we win the chip this year and silence the Nets fans.
I was browsing through the comments and.. this loss hurt you didn't it? 

Try being a little realistic. Maybe start by admitting to yourself that it's absolutely ridiculous the Nets get blown out by a Lakers squad without Lebron, AD, Kuzma, Gasol and Matthews, even if the Nets were without Harden and had time restrictions for Durant.

Furthermore, stop with the Kyrie bullshit. Lakers were up when he was ejected and lost Schroeder themselves (who is actually very important with all of these injuries).

No, this game does not mean the Nets have no chance for the title. It's a real bad look though and it's kinda weird some Nets fans can't admit that.
I open mouth kissed a horse once.
Lmao just saw your bad take a couple of comments above, and here you are again, saltier than a hot pretzel. 

Your takes suck. You don’t know shit about basketball. You’re probably bad in bed. And your gf cheats with the neighbour.
He thought we'd miss that lmao
We will. Once everyone's healthy, we'll be just fine.
It's his Green Lantern ring
He needs his hair back in a tail. With his hair down he's been underwhelming
I been watching basketball since 91 boy sit your ass down.

The game has evolved.
I hope for both teams' sakes that neither look anything like they did today

No Harden, AD, or Bron means we got robbed of what both coaches and systems are really capable of

also I hope that if they did meet in the finals that there aren't a lot of ejections
it won't be this because this was a blowout
Yes, I agree
“Their confidence will only skyrocket from here on out because they just saw what they are capable of” 
Some YouTube comment on the game pretty much describing why it’s important.
I enjoyed it
Aren't that Nets still currently in second place in the East regardless? Acting like the Nets haven't been dropping games against Bulls and Magic are barely beating the Pistons recently...

Edit: At least the Griz are in a playoff spot in the West, and the Pels far better than Bulls and Magic most nights.
So I guess people should stop overreacting and calling the Nets a superteam?
Fair enough. It’s hard to tell how good they can be when they have one of their stars injured. I still think they are weak in defending centers but they have enough fire power to get through it. They beat the bucks by 2 but kyrie was out. Giannis scored 35 that game too. So he did feast but it still wasn’t enough in a high scoring game. Pretty sure the sixers and nets both beat each other but were facing injuries
Yup I agree. Yes the nets weren’t fully healthy but a extra half of kyrie and having harden back won’t fix the defensive issues. I watched a ton of Blake on the pistons this year and he hasn’t been great on defenses either. He has been better with the nets but man Tatum literally picked him out for the game winner. Will be interesting if they get the rotation figured on defense
Yes the schedule was easy but that doesn't mean anything. The Lakers were 1st in the ranking even before the season started, their roster was so deep and talented before the acquisitions and now is even better with Benny Mac and Drummond. Honestly fully healthy the Lakera didn't have a single team that could match them in West, the only 3 team that could cause problems to them are all on the East side.
He was just acting out cause his father figure wasnt playing
Him and Schroder really feel like they'll make the biggest difference between regular and post season. Obviously Lebron and AD will ball out but those two could make it so the Lakers easily win 16 games.
Thank you brother. Lakers 2001, but keep in mind that this year both Kobe and Shaq made all-defensive second team and were pitbulls in the playoffs.
[I found this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7pd661/serious_since_defensive_ratings_were_introduced/dsgdvng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

And I also found out that the ‘01 Lakers ranked 19th during the regular season, but turned up their defense during the play offs.
Multiple teams have had 3 superstars, and it led to them winning championship because their combined skills were balanced. It isn't the case with the Nets. Harden is a perfect point guard and leader, but Kyrie and KD basically do the same thing; they don't run around off the ball like Steph or Klay to get open catch and shoot opportunities. They just wait for the ball to play iso ball and score. Who is Nets all-defensive player? There's none. What Nets player can go to work down low, crush boards when it matters most, and hammer some putbacks in a game 6 when everyone is exhausted? There's none. The Nets have zero paint beast, they have zero perimeter lockdown defender, they dont have a trio that's cohesive enough to play the kind of team ball you need to win a championship, they won't even make it out of the East.
I mean they are a super team, they’re just not a great one
Nobody forgot that. We had no AD or Schröder. They still had Harden and Kyrie. That’s what’s nice about having a bullshit superteam with 3 superstars. But there’s no way they should’ve lost to us while we’re so hobbled
So we can’t celebrate a win? Lmao get out of here.
Can you relax it's a joke
They are obviously beatable considering they got their ass cheeks clapped by a B squad tonight lol.
He was obviously kidding, smart guy
[deleted]
It’s so dumb I see so many people saying they “ran through” the west by beating the Warriors, Kings, Suns, Clippers, and us (without AD or Schröder). They had good wins against the Clippers and Suns but they should’ve beat us and that’s the luxury of having 3 superstars. That’s not running through the west lol
Lol no they didn’t “run through” shit
They played against Pelicans with defense and ended Zion's streak. Their defense is better now with LMA when they replaced Deandre with him.
Whatever makes you sleep at night 😂😂
As in I knew I couldnt extrapolate much from this game due to too many missing essentially pieces from both teams but enjoy yourself. Lakers fans living up to the reputation
There wasn’t any Lebron or AD. Lakers had worst disadvantage. Get gud.
[deleted]
Playmaker with zero assists?
Didn’t lebron win 2 MVPs in Miami
LeBron played bozo
they didnt play more than half the game tho
The Lakers kids, i.e. the non-superstar Lakers. You guys are really bad at taking a joke
I meant baby Lakers as in the non-superstar Lakers who played tonight. Otoh Laker fans such as yourself are legit babies
That's impressive.
No team has 2 superstars aside from the lakers and nets and there sno guarantee kd will be superstar lvl playoffs.. No team has role players as good as the lakers.
Yes you can lmao that's not how that works at all
No, it’s not. We had close games and the Clips came out on top. This was a blowout while we’re hobbled against a team that had 2 of their 3 superstars
Lol he's one of our best and most active defenders this season what are you talking about
Fine cowards!!
I'm a little confused by this actually. How come Thanasis all of a sudden has a role on your team? Injuries, or some sudden leap?
Can you explain the cigar mantle reference I'm not familiar with it
Rip Tim Boyle
Thanasis has honestly looked really solid off the bench. Big wing, very strong, has solid instincts, plus defender, and a good cutter on offense. Took him a while to develop and Bud is surely working his magic, but the nepotism signing has honestly worked out for the Bucks
Carrots can help you fake a drug test?
He gives us exactly what we needed. I’m not a huge fan of him trying to create his own shots but he’s great off the pick and roll and on the boards. Definitely a steal.
roulette has the worst odds for a random bet, only 45%. Blackjack is better.
Yeah, I’m guessing he just took the chance cause $50 wouldn’t be a massive loss. Obviously this was an anomaly he was able to get lucky on.
It seems crazy, but Nets were favored by 10.5. That puts the -21 Lakers line up to 31.5, effectively. I cant find a good site that calculates this high, but even a 15.5 point underdog wins just under 5% of the time. My guess is 31.5 point swings from the line are far less than 1%, so 100:1 odds seems very reasonable.  If I was on my work computer, I could likely model this better to give a more accurate estimate on the probability of this event occurring.

Lmao exactly what I told him. A broken clock is right twice a day!
Love the stat where he shot better while being guarded.
Lakers Legend J.R. "Henny" Swish
Nuggets, Knicks, Cavs, Lakers legend JR Smith.
Benny Mac is not decent on defense at times. He’s pretty bad which is why he struggles to crack rotations. He’s a good shooter though and he def has the athleticism.
The warriors really fumbled the bag : could’ve had it so easy for the whole decade with curry green Thompson and other stars yet they decided to play their players injured and just ruined a legacy with shit acquisitions as well
Cant let a few months of whatever play from him in Houston fog people from the reality that PJ can be hella legit, especially if he's playing with freaking Giannis
Capela was last year...

Bestbrook, tho' .. feast and famine and locker room guy
They got Capela last year
Injury prevention? Like a guy coming in being a. It nervous bit tight (maybe doesn’t have a place to live or is just renting one and isn’t moved in completely), makes some mistakes to tries a little too hard and gets injured...

Or maybe that’s just bs.
I've never gambled, but I listen to a lot of sports podcasts so there's a lot of betting talk and parlays always sound like they're fun but also basically lighting your money on fire.
> I farted on my dog with rage

Why would you do that to your dog? Also, what was the dog's reaction?
He’s going to need to for sixers to win
W 4 losses
AD can guard Embiid though. Nobody goes at AD (cough Chris Paul going at Gobert cough)
They should just say fuck it and play Claxton at the 4 against AD
AD^2
Yeah, in the playoffs AD playing 5 is something else.
They were motivated before that tbh
Bruh, I'm wondering why y'all still continuing with the ejections lol. 

At this rate, you'll have half your team left by next week.
Not all, but definitely a lot. Nets lacked a ball handler in a lot of those minutes, and the Lakers were really deflecting all the poor passes with good rotations. Nets role players hardly got up enough shots and harden is the key to that for sure. Kyrie and kd aren't nearly as good at getting others involved. 

Kd looked bad and nets needed to be a bit more physical
and Kyrie who was ejected. KD was on minute restrictions.
Yes.
Lol yeah I think they should be favorites/equals/slightly below Lakers depending how you look at it. Anyone saying hand it to them is stupid especially cause it's their first year
Almost like they were missing their MVP-winning lead guard tonight
I don't lmao but good for you
Pretty sure kyries most recent tweet explains that
I'm not saying they are pathetic I'm saying they looked pathetic, which they did
Weren't we missing AD and schroeder that game?
He shoots 50% from the field and 48% from 3. He had a bad game but if you're actually taking that away from it 🤡
I rather have a LA team win then KD and the Superfriends so same. Hopefully we get healthy and we have our long awaited battle for LA.
Soft af, Clippers fan
Same goes for you! Pretty please :)
KNICKS SWEEP NETS IN ROUND ONE
vogel's secrit play: frank vogel
His offensive schemes never changed. It was really just the guys not hitting shots they normally make and the defense allowing easy buckets.
They were in the ECF against LeBron Heatles lmao
He almost took out the heatles with Paul George as his best player give him his damn respect.
He had to play against Bron lol; now he has him
It's hard to win shit when you have to go through the Big 3 Miami Heat
To be fair he was a Roy Hibbert rebound away from beating Prime Lebron and going to the finals
He took prime athletic big 3 Heat to game 7 twice.
tbf he was going against prime lebron every year
it’s almost like now he has players that play well in big games
Turns out adding LeBron and AD to a legit defensive coach works out
This is a player driven league. Coaching matters, but you need to have pieces too.

You can ask a master chess player to use only pawns, and they wouldn't be successful either.
Defense. Wins. Championships.
>Guy couldn't win shit in Indiana and NOW he can actually win big games

That's because you don't need offensive X and Os when you've got LeBron and AD creating your offense for you
It doesn’t get talked enough about but Game 6 of the finals was crazy to watch
Hard to compare with how many players got swapped out tho
Would've called you crazy 2 years ago. But he's really grown up before our eyes. MWP must've given him a good workout.
It was crazy to say 2 years when he was just getting absolutely cooked in the perimeter by anyone, even my Hornets, but now he's just taken such a huge stride that you could even put him to lock up kawhi.
And Gasol and Wes

Tho I think Caruso is pretty easily third
I would say 4th schroder imo is a better defender not as switchable but better overall defender.
The lakers 3rd best defender is definitely Schroeder lol
I love watching Kuz. He has 1 or 2 shaq’n moments a game. He’ll be on fire then drive to the hole and kick the ball out to a team mate & the pass goes 12 ft over the guys head or there will be no body standing there lol
I’m referring to wingspan, not height. Players don’t block shots and deflect passes with their head. I wonder if that’s allowed tho...
Will never forget man:

You think the Lakers' package is enough for AD? LMAO

LMAO the Lakers gave up too much

Pelinka doesn't even know the salary cap!!

What team will help the Lakers help clear cap space lol (Wizards do)

No way AD waives the trade kicker (he does)

Howard and Rondo? Pelinka surrounded Bron and AD with scraps. WASHED (they weren't)

Vogel?? LMAO Jason Kidd gonna replace him by December!!
God she is such garbage. Literally ruins Mason and Ireland show anytime she's near it. Plus who's blows a trusted friendship with mother fucking jeanie buss....
And then she was blacklisted
I'll take Rob over Kurt
Oh god the strike every time I think about it and those neck beards there I cringe.
Except it was the off-season he built a championship team. It wasn’t a disaster at all.
And the “we want lue” chants
Attack of the Rambii lmaoooo
I remember Frank Vogel not having much of a team around him in Orlando during his last season. Fournier, Vuc, and Gordon all missed at least 24 games. Jonathon Isaac, their first pick, played a grand total of 27 games before getting injured. It’s kinda hard to build anything when everyone’s out.
Snyder is a huge betting favorite to win coach of the year, Williams is second but he’s definitely not p much a lock
Both of them doing it without the ideal rosters
And nick nurse, nick is arguably better then them
Vogels guys get time off from defence
Lobbying for Quin too. He basically turned Gobert into the best defender we've seen in a decade. This team really has no business being a top 3 defense in the league.
Weren't they peers?
Then you haven’t been watching the games. Plus the best defensive rating in the league while missing our defensive anchor for over half the season and missing LeBron for the last 10+ games. Just watch how the team rotates and how they almost always make the right decision. We’ve been the 2nd best defense even while missing Bron and AD, all while integrating players as they leave and come back from injury
That’s all you need with bron bron on your team.
There were reports about the LeBron camp having questions about how modern Vogel's offenses would be. That was fair at the time. I mean Vogel's offense still kinda sucks. Last season we had to manufacture offense at times because it was so ghastly.
duopsony
because offense is better than nothing

if you can name better alternatives they could have gotten with the same ease and lack of commitment, then please feel free to
Skip's a fad, we know that. What we really wanna see is Shannon having a field day while wearing the Lakers gear, with the goat mask on, crown on top and a cigar to top it off.

SKKKKIIIIIIIIIIIUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPP!
I was gonna rage at you until I read "Skip probably"
If he doesn't put it up right away they should bench him, cause his shooting is literally the only thing he's in there for. It's not like he's in there for defensive purposes 😂
and it absolutely rules
LeAnchorman
LeWeatherboy
LebRon Burgundjames
Thanks bruh, ive actually been looking for this gif for a while.
LeBron + AD kinda eliminated him
Vogel got 0 first place votes, 6 2nd place votes, 18 3rd place votes. Finished 4th place. 18 points less than 3rd place Spo and only 7 points more than 5th place Taylor Jenkins from Memphis.
Vogel is easily a top 5 coach, best since Phil Jackson without a doubt. So glad we got him instead of Tyronn Lue
Its the overperformer of the gear award
Vogel is smart. What does COTY have against a winning legacy? Most fans generally don’t care how many COTY’s Jackson, Pop, or Auerbach have. 

If he keeps doing his job, which is giving stars solid defensive systems, the Lakers will hold him for years to come.
It is same sa Matt LeFleur and Rodgers. He wasn't even considered for COTY and he had 13-3 in both of his first two seasons but people dismiss it because he has Rodgers.
Nick Nurse didn't get the award until the season after his championship
Yep. Vogel’s coaching has been fucking mind-blowing this season but Snyder will get COTY because the Jazz has the best record
I wouldn’t go that far. But Vogel should at least get the clout from having some votes thrown his way.
> but you and I both know how they pick COTY

Is it with a dance-off ‽‽‽
I can see them dishing it to Quinn Snyder or Monty Williams.
Awards really are just to make the media feel important and it's sad.
He should have had it last year. Best exec in the league. Nets will get it though because of all the high profile signings.
Nah whoever the Nets GM is will probably get it because they signed a bunch of stars and the Lakers will roll to another ring while the Nets will get bounced in the early rounds just like the clips last year.
you just know Suns' guy is winning it for signing CP3
*checks flair* ["We?"](https://youtu.be/1CxqYWi5vzc?t=1m19s)
The Lakers were short like 7 players today...you gotta be kidding me with this take.

At least Nets had KD
3? We're forgetting kuz, wes, and gasol. .
Kyrie and KD played a combined 45 minutes..

Although Lakers defence is fantastic tho, Griffin and Lemarcus have looked fantastic since the trade, but Lakers made them look the washed version of themselves that everyone was going on about.
It was a 4 point game when Kyrie was still in the game. KD played on a minutes restriction, was it really that big of a deal?
>I trust Kidd

Lol
I think people forgot how good the Lakers were after the Nets got together
We can't see straight right now from this win.  We needed it.
????? I did watch the whole game. The Lakers were up pretty much the whole first half regardless of Kyrie being in the game. The Lakers also lost their best offensive player in Schroeder during the game too. And Durant still played 25 minutes, Schroeder played less than him...
It still does give you a glimpse into the supporting cast of both teams, and the defensive potential of the Lakers (who are already #1 in Net Rating) and the defensive struggles of the Nets (who are #25 in Net Rating)
Lol no LeBron/AD/Kuzma is a little different than no Harden. KD and Kyrie played. Stop making excuses. This game meant something.
lol nothing? Nets shouldve coasted on this game but like what Mark Jackson said in this game. You cant take shortcuts and expect to win just because you a team full of stars.
I think that's likely
Nah if we are 7 or 8 seed we gucci. No way Bron lost 1 elimination game, let alone 2.
My dream is portland in the first round. Please. 

TOO LITTLE
Was gonna comment pretty much the same thing. All we've gathered is Lakers second stringers might be better than the Nets'. With so many key players out, this game represents like 4-5 mins of actual playing time with the squads that were active tonight. Sure we didn't have Bron/AD/Kuz, but that just means we don't know what they'll look like against this Nets team.
Always been that way.
Except yours considering you're trying too hard lmao.
*Lebron, AD, and Drummond who will eat up everything off the glass
3 dudes running from the grind vs. built different playoff opponents
please let it happen
More like Giannis, Embiid and Jokic 😏
My point is that he will look even more dominant. Nets don’t have someone like Gasol to throw at him and slow him down at least.
Except against Steven Adams
But it’s nice watching supposed super teams fall apart. Like the Clippers last year.
I agree with both of you
Idk I’d rather close out a game against Simmons,Embiid and Danny Green than KD, Harden and Irving. Some of you guys take entirely too much away from the 82 game preseason.
The fact that they were losing even before Kyrie kinda makes this even worse. This was at best the Lakers C+ team and they were getting destroyed by Schröder and Drummond lol.
Eh... Dennis was having the better game. 

He might have had his best game as a Laker if he’d gotten to play it out.
Kyrie hadn't had a single assist yet and KD was like 1:1 on assists.
Not having Harden destroys the Nets more than not having Kyrie or KD. They better make sure Harden is healthy and ready for the playoffs because Kyrie and KD can't elevate the rest of the Nets to the level Harden can. It's becoming more and more obvious that the Nets really are Harden's team, even if he joined the party a little late.
Agreed. Jokic is MVP this year and I’m all for it. Love the dude. Granted, we want to crush him and his team in the playoffs, but he’s SO fun to watch. And so good.
Why did you say "and maybe even Giannis"? Genuine question.
Which is fine.. don't rush KD back. Let him get healthy and learn the new team. More important that a regular season win.
11 assists though
11 ast to only 4 turnovers. 3 steals & good overall defense. 40% from 3. Was rock steady as a ball handler when Dennis got hurt & then ejected. We know hw can finish at the rim well, tonight was an anomaly. It was everything else I mentioned that shows his growth as a player.
6-12 but yeah he was nice
He's really improved in the sense that he used to try dumbass layups when going in. These last few games, he dumped it to Trez or anyone inside alot more for an easier bucket.


But yeah, he tries to power dunk at least once each game.

Lol
he has and one day he is going to get himself a poster.
Can’t be easy to see exactly where you’re dunking when you have Inspector Gadget arms.
it feels like he misses one dunk every game. in fairness to him, most of then are contested like in this game but it looks like his speed and momentum throws the ball too horizontally and it hits the back of the ring.
Tbh I'm beyond glad he's getting these minutes. Rookies generally don't get to play high minutes for contending teams.

I know he isn't a rookie but even so.
I honestly think y’all can beat them easily. If they can’t guard Drummond then how are they gonna guard Simmons and embiid?
Cut Bron and AD, return to young core
Lol the pure insanity of that take considering they just won a championship is hilarious
Lebrons gunna see this and tweet it tomorrow
The east won't be safe as well in a couple months, apparently Earthquake GOAT is coming
That’s literally what makes him so great. Not only is he an absolute incredible individual player, but his biggest strength is how good he makes people around him
True man, the bench gets a TON of practice. The bench is going to be strong going into the playoffs. That’s scary.
I kinda want to see another “Clippers blow a 3-1 lead to see the Lakers in the WCF”, is that wrong of me?
Right? Not to mention we already have depth problems with the amount of dudes out. We’d have a situation similar to the Raptors the other night for multiple games lol
Literally will be left with Wes (who's always injured) + Alex. To be fair we would also sign Ben
God, the crew is fucking garbage. The same thought went through my head.
I know, but I meant had he been on our team and gotten injured. That on top of missing LeBron and Davis. Now we’re missing Kuz, Wes, and Gasol. There’s a chance Schroeder misses some time after tonight. We’d have no depth if we made the trade. It was really frustrating to keep hearing people treat it like a one for one ya know?
who happens to have a fat ass
He's still out. Point stands
give da man some respect
5-6 is really good compared the records the Cavs had when LeBron missed games
I mean they are 5-6 without LeBrow and have missed plenty of other guys during this same stretch. That's impressive no matter how you slice it. Basically maintaining a .500 record while missing upwards of 3 starters.
Lakers could beat NYK, CHA, BOS with the way they are playing the past 3 games.
ye i hope they trade for this lebron guy i think hes kinda good and only a cheerleader right now
Probably updated after this game. That’s insane with no Bron or AD.
Based on what?  Its been number two the whole time, might even have gone back to number one if it updated.
Lakers have the 1st defense over the whole season and the 2nd defense over the last 11 games without Bron and AD according to NBA.com. Where are you getting 5th?
Built different 😤💪🏽
that stuff 🔥💯
You have better role players than Nets.
Sure, but the big 3 on the Nets are way more impactful than most of the guys on the Lakers that were missing. Losing Kyrie also probably made them lose their flow. Like I said asterisk next to this game.
I guess you didn't watch the game then? Cause that's exactly what happened. I mean unless you want to go back to the game that did have Lebron James and gang minus AD who lost to the KD-less Nets last time...
Yeah I don’t know what that guy is talking about but they couldn’t stop harden much either
To be fair, most people cant
Buddy said Harden containing Bron..
Skip still downplays the Cavs' 2016 title *and* acts like the Clippers blowing their 3-1 lead last year was the Lakers' fault. If the Lakers indeed repeat as champions, he'll 100% find a way to spin in so that LeBron actually had an easier road lmao.
Imo what makes the nets scary is that they have an identity that goes from the coaching staff down to their 12th man.  Their squad is all about offense and they embrace that.  When you combine that with talent like Harden, KD, and Kyrie it's enough to make them title favorites against almost any team.

I think Lebron is the great equalizer in all of this though.  If that man can dictate the tempo and flow of the game against those Warriors teams then I dont see why he cant control the game against the Nets.  He has enough tools and weapons on the team now to dismantle and dissect the Nets relatively weak defense.  I could see Bron averaging a 30 point triple double in a 6 game series against these guys.  But the Nets ARE scary tho.
>Coaching matters, MDA never coached defense

2017-2018 Rockets were one of the better defensive teams in the NBA,true a lot of that was on that assistant but still MDA was the HC and was calling all the shots.
Steve Nash was average to plus on team defense

But now, that team is led by Harden, and Kyrie, who don't set a great example on defense, and KD, who can play defense, but floats along (and is out too often this year).


They are still going to be scary in the postseason..
i'm surely biased, but I don't think a healthy Lakers-Nets finals tells us if offense or defense wins championships

when the playoffs start and the lakers stop fucking around, their offense can hang with anyone because lebron and AD just do everything

nets would still be much better, i think, but lakers are not going to be as bad as they look right now
If you are watching Nets games this season, Irving is far from awful defensively, especially the past month or so.

But go on with your shitty hot takes tonight. It’s warranted.
Joe Harris is a good defender what are you on about. Also KD is an excellent on ball defender as well.
Harden has been good on defense, its hilarious every time a big tries to back him down and has to pass out cause they can't move him. You're stuck in 2014 kid, using a 2 minute lowlight video, try actually watching basketball for once. He literally locked Kawhi up the entire game last time they played 🤡
Yeah idk who they expect to put on Bron and AD lmao on top of Drummond bullying whoever’s their center
ay no jeff green slander, i love that man
Top finisher of all time*
LeBron fears Claxton
Harden is literally their LeBron. This sub is tripping balls. Nets are going to be scary come postseason.
Of those 6 games they’ve played the 14-39 Rockets, the Hornets without Lamelo, the 22-29 Bulls, the barely above .500 Knicks, the 23-29 Pelicans, and a Lebron, AD, Kuz, Gasol, Wes-less Lakers.
Lol Lakers nephews came out tonight dude don't even try. They are nephews for a reason.
Yup. Decision making is his main issue as all young players! People forget he is 20
Claxton is nice, but all I think about is Playboi Carti when i see his hair lmao
I like how you decide "what I know" lmao mad. It doesnt change the fact before Harden came when KD and Kyrie were both playing they were below .500, then he sat and Harden came in and put the team on his back. I give credit where it's due.
Agreed, the Cavs were no slouches defensively but they were a team set up to be an offensive juggernaut behind LeBron.
Agreed but just to be clear the Nets have only been good when Harden played, they were a game below .500 when it was just KD and Kyrie, then Harden came and carried a win streak to the 1st seed, KD and Kyrie can get buckets but they just can't carry an offense tbh. And I'm not trying to take away from the Lakers win, yall smacked the Nets tonight cause they still should have been able to win with just them two, or even with just one of them tbh with yalls missing players lmaooo nice win
Doesn't look like Deandre got any minutes either.
Yep our best player fernandopoejr couldn't play tonight. Was a surprise we won
Fair enough. Definitely an inexcusable loss, and hopefully the Nets use this as a learning experience to improve their defensive schemes. Good win by the lakers. However, I wouldn't cite this as evidence of a potential result of a finals matchup for the same reason I wouldn't use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTqZUP0YjtM) as evidence either.
I recall watching Caruso and THT playing significant minutes throughout.
Two of the leagues best players
But he makes the offense unstoppable to the point the defense doesn't matter. Yall are seriously underrating Harden. Like I 100% get that with KD and Kyries reputation they should have smacked that Lakers line up but they just can't carry like Harden, they can get you a crucial bucket but can't carry an entire offense. They were a game below .500 before Harden came and carried them to the 1 seed on an insane winstreak where he swept the west coast lol and that was WITH lebron, no AD tho, but also no KD. Harden doesn't just get buckets he gets his teammates buckets, not just KD and Kyrie either, he gets everyone on the team no matter how bad buckets. This kind of proves the point Harden fans have been saying, these dudes have just had better teams and thats the only reason they have rings and he doesn't but he's clearly better than both lol
Especially the nets because you know... Blow out...
But Kyrie still played the first half and Lakers lost Dennis too.
So was Dennis
That shit is hilarious. Now he’s saying “Lakers playing like game 7 finals”. Like just take the L dude.
and there are none. the Nets did not show up today and the Lakers did. onto the next one
Lmao the realization that Lakers are about to repeat is setting in and so the denial begins.
Ehhhh except they aren't.
Yeah, he was on some Jordan ish that game
I wasn’t rooting for/against either team so it was awesome seeing KD, Kyrie, and Sexton all go off like that. Super fun basketball to watch
Same here. Or the Jazz.
I agree fully, and I think our coaching staff has made fantastic adjustments to keep this team afloat during this injury time. While last year we had some solid veteran leadership to help throughout the year, this young(er) team, especially the new additions, seem to be flowing just fine.

Coach Vogels defensive mastery is really showing as well and I'm loving seeing everyone buying in and applying themselves fully.
Vogel is really good at defensive matchups
Wes you can since he's part of our regular rotation. But I agree about duds
Denver literally has no answer for Bron and AD.
Who are they gonna put on Bron and AD lol
Grant is better than Gordon.

And we beat them in 5...
we run Denver lol, only teams to be worried about if we are fully healthy is the Clips and Nets
5-6 games lakers
I don't think so. Gordon can do an okay job but he isn't stopping playoff Bron or AD. Against Jokic, a healthy AD will at least be able to limit Jokic somewhat. Throw in Drummond, Marc for some physical presence and Vogel's defensive schemes, Lakers can do a decent job on Jokic. That will force Denver to try and use Murray, MPJ and Gordon more. KCP, Caruso and Schroder are good defenders. Kuzma has improved a lot from last season. He'll be fine against MPJ or Gordon.

The Clippers are the biggest threat for the Lakers.
 Still on my Rondo high, after years of hating him for 08.. I don't want to hate him again so soon..
I see you're a man used to being broke on bad bets
Denver still isn't a very good defensive team though. For that matter, neither are the Clippers.
Not a take its actually a fact. Dont live in texas you should be embarrased to live in the U.S
Blowout cuz Bam and dragic missed games..how is it dumb when its a fact🤣
Lol, you nephews are wilding with the hot takes

It’s a single regular season game
He said in an interview just now that he didn’t realize he got the first tech and he got the second tech for waiving bye to Kyrie lmao
Kyrie got into Dennis’ face and then refused to cool down. Refs did the right thing by removing him.
Ok, but those guys are nowhere near as impactful as the superstars lol
How... what type of horse was it
In brightest day, in blackest night?
Not sure why all the downvotes, considering everyone pretty much agreed with me in the other thread. You write like a 10 year old, so I'm not sure if 'boy' is apt.
Why? Harden didn’t play, kyrie got ejected and KD played 20 mins. They are a super team due to 3 superstars
The game that 76'ers won only had Harden on the Nets playing against the full 76'ers squad.
You're really underestimating Jazz right now the most. They have been killing it with their 3 point playing and 3rd in defense. The Clippers are also so much better around the perimeter along with Rondo now being their PG/playmaker and actually playing games together. Nuggets got like 10x better with Aaron Gordon and Javale Mcgee as back up center. The Suns are also playing very well with Chris Paul and Booker. It isn't looking that easy as it was last season that's for sure.
There’s been nobody in the past 20-25 years who has had the firepower the nets have. They don’t need an elite defence to win the title. Just a good enough one to get stops and let the offence take over. They may not win the title but I don’t see anybody in the east being good enough offensively to keep up with them. Lakers are one team with Davis and Drummond inside who will give them serious problems on the boards and in the paint.
No they shouldn’t but they did and it happens. Let’s not act like nets lost with their big 3 and with everybody playing heavy mins. They basically had a mins restriction KD on the floor in that 2nd half that’s it
this guy called the nets a fake ass team cause they lost a regular season game
Lol, good shit. Keep being in denial
GSW, SAC, PHO, LAL, LAC, SAC, all in a row but whatever.
What does going unbeaten on the west trip mean then? They beat suns and clippers without KD
Seems like you’re the one trying to cope lol
There’s still a lot that can be extrapolated when you get blown out by our hobbled team. Obviously it’s one regular season game, but still an embarrassing loss that you bandwagon fans are trying to diminish by a justified ejection
[deleted]
So when Nets - KD beat Lakers with Lebron and gang - AD, I guess Lakers needed to get good too? Guess Lebron needs to get good so he doesn't have his team lose to the Nets lmao.
You must trying hard to convince yourself considering you are trying to reply back to me multiple times. Guess it must be true
He didn’t demand a trade and shit on Cleveland for 10 games to start his Heat career. C’mon dude
LeBron left in free agency
Yeah I take that bit back. My bad lmao.
You right, I take it back. Still 1 star vs 2. Today was 2 vs none so people will obviously overreact.
Maybe you’re just bad at making them
I'm sorry I gave you flash backs to being bullied in high school.
it makes it so they dont need to rush either one of them back.
Clippers and Sixers (arguably) do too. There would be even more if Harden wouldn’t have joined an actual superteam, which is why his move to the Nets was so weak. Yeah our role players are better but that’s credit to Rob
Uh that’s exactly how it works lol no way he’s winning MVP
I mean Paul George didnt play in the first game, but the second was closer.

This time, 2 of 3 but one was ejected and the other had a minutes restriction.

Earlier this season the nets won without kd and with harden in a new system against Lakers with LeBron.

All I am saying is that this is the regular season, teams don't care as much as in playoffs.  Obviously they want to win, but there isnt much riding on this.  People are coming to conclusions about the Nets after a night where neither team was full.  It doesn't mean much.
But it’s one game nothing more, nets beat Lakers in LA with lebron playing
You’ll thank me when you sober up
Sudden leap. He's a good sparkplug and his overall skills have improved.

I'd say his energy is sneaky-good on defense because he was certainly frustrating the hell out of Luka in the Mavs game recently.
Thanasis is a winning player due to effort and at this stage of his career he's experienced enough to make his effort valuable.
He's been getting good. Dude I love him. He was so bad but he gave his all 100%. He was just so fucking raw (pause) but the potential is there
one word, handles
He’s actually surprisingly good. He has a ton of energy on defense and super athletic. He can get too overzealous and make some dumb plays but that’ll change with experience. If he got more time to develop last year he could probably be a higher end role player. Plus there’s the bonus of him being the best hype man in the league.
It started with Darko Milicic, I think, and it essentially just describes a player who’s so bad that them getting in the game is basically gloating that it’s over. So they’re like the human version of the cigar you smoke to celebrate a win.
Red Auerbach was the Celtics coach during their 1960s dynasty. He would light up a cigar on the sidelines when he thought a win was in the bag.
You ever seen the movie Shoot 'Em Up?
For sure. Drummond as a 1st/2nd option on a lottery team is a whole different ballgame than Drummond as a role player narrowly focusing on his strengths. Lakers knew exactly what they were doing.
Nets should’ve targeted Drummond tbh. Idk why they didn’t.
im almost certain hes gonna give us some headaches when he gets an offensive board and tries a post move instead of kicking it back out to lebron or ad
He gave flashes of his "post moves" during the game. It's going to be interesting when AD returns to see if Drummond is really willing to accept a diminished role.
what made tonight's starting 5 so fun is that drummond was really the only guy that had to fight down low. shooters were open and fast breaks were killing it. tbh i wanna see this set more. i kinda feel like kuzma was getting in dre's way when they played together
He's also one the best in steals in the league, often in the top 10. When he's hot, he's the best offensive rebounder in the league. And the whole talk about him having a terrible percentage is just some bs echo from 5 years ago. Drummond is a beast, and a must have starter on any team with good stretch 4s. The Lakers are going to be unstoppable in the playoffs.
That's my point
One of my favorite Knicks of all time
Give it time. Vogel will fix that
It's like going to a casino: gamble solely for entertainment, and never gamble more than you can afford to lose. If you treat it that way, it'll be like any other form of entertainment and won't wreck havoc on your life. 

Even when I earned enough to have disposable income to gamble, I hardly ever did. For some reason my brain must be wired differently because gambling is less entertaining to me than almost any other form of entertainment.
I’d say Jokic and Embiid are the two people AD has trouble guarding, that’s why we have Marc and Dre on the team
I mean AD will probably play the 5, then you rotate him with a fresh drummond of the bench and yeah, nets fucked.
Had the lead like 95% of the game
This, the fact that the lakers were tied through two quarters against Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant is an embarassment, how much help you need to beat the lakers C squad?
Right the past 3 games had ejections the refs are wilding 🤣
i didn’t catch the game. why’d kyrie and schroeder get into it?
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think it's a straight up "yes" for me. I don't feel the Nets (without Harden) are OP at all, even with all the freebie vets. Harden can take a scrub team deep into the playoffs. Add even just Durant, it starts to get silly.

Durant as a single player (measuring his scoring and defense) is the better player, but for making a team OP, I'm always going to go with the playmaker's impact. And no, Kyrie doesn't count (he's capable of some playmaking, but he's not Harden.)
KD played right at as many mins as the rest of the starters so they didnt restrict him much. They took him out after lakers took over a 20 point lead or he would hit right at 30. He was a -13 when he was in so he didnt help that much. Also only 4 players on the lakers had more mins than durant so he was in the majority of the game before it became a blowout.
? 
 
Wanna know who the Lakers were missing?
Cool, now do the Lakers
Definitely
Of course yall were. What I'm getting at is, this game was an anomaly. The lakers were shooting lights out from 3, while the nets couldn't buy a buckets from 3. Everyone saying this nets team won't beat Philly is tripping. They're still the favorites to win it all as well. If both of these teams meet in the finals fully healthy, I say it goes 6 with nets taking it! Now if the lakers manage to push it to a game 7, then.......🤷🏻‍♂️
He’s a scrub.
Lol for real. I don’t want the Lakers to win this year but the last thing I’m going to do is tell 76ers fans I really hope their team can beat them and win it all this year.
Lakers Knicks finals confirmed. espn gonna blow up
The Vogel Special
Thanks to Hibbert and George Hill.
That was Hibbert and George Hill.
That was such a good series to watch
my initial thought upon hiring was he got to the ECF with Hibbert and PG and literally gets to run a team with much better versions of those players. Although AD and Roy Hibbert couldn't be further away from each other offensively but you know
No of course he did but that team completely fell apart on his watch which was an indictment on the culture that was created there. Hibbert was the best center in the league for like 18 months and after that season was one of the worst. Literally one of the most unexplainable things that has happened in NBA history. Vogel has flaws but at least he's showing how it ended in Indiana wasn't his fault. There was a lot of shit happening that 13-14 season.
Isn't that squad got a better record that the Heatles?
In 030 itll still be prime lebron..only difference is that he will be dunking on his son
LBJ, AD, and Dudley are out and the defense is still one of the best defensive teams.
Yea it was perfect execution, felt almost textbook the way they handled it.
vogel started alex caruso for the first time all season in game 6, and it worked
Game 6 was legitimately one of the best defensive games I can remember in the Finals
Is anybody ready to admit that Butler only scoring 12 points was essentially a choke job by him? Or are we still circlejerking him to death?
Yea for sure. But if a team can tread water with their stars and top rotation pieces missing serious time, that's reliable depth you can use in the playoffs. A lot of these guys might not play more than 10-15 mins a night in a 7 game series, but those minutes can buy time for their stars or build leads against teams in the post-season. This is promising if they can more results like this until their main guys are back
I wonder what this says about the Lakers and not being able to develop young talent. Kuz is the only guy that stuck around from the young core and he's definitely matured a great deal as a defender.
like januaryish last year he morphed into an entirely different person who is unbelievably good on defense. Maybe he just realized "if I want to continue to ride AD/Lebron's coattails to a championship I better play good defense."
>I wonder if that’s allowed tho...

No rule against it.  Theoretically a player could grow a 6' Afro and block everything.
That was the funniest shit. Like really? Even Magic's hating ass said Rob had to teach him the cap. They are never going to give Rob his just due. Kobe was spot in about that man.
The odd thing is people forgot Vogel coaches that overachieving Indiana team that gave the Celtics, Bulls, and Heatles problems
I think of [this](https://youtu.be/VfKTJqFa3go) every time someone brings up those past comments. Such a satisfying moment
Pelinka is GOAT
LeBron just came to make movies!
It was Rambis who hired Vogel.
By strike are y'all trying to say boycott or protest? A strike is when employees refuse to show up/work
I am ok with it. It shows how passionate fans are with their lakers.
I meant in the moment buddy.
Oh, agreed. But I also get why people were nervous when Vogel came to LA. He had those good years in Indiana, did nothing of note with Orlando, and was coming to pick up the pieces of Walton. That was a tough job and Vogel wasn't an obvious hire. 

He's done amazing though. So has Rob. It's a huge turnaround from the rest of the 2010s.
Idc what the betting odds are I every time I hear a reporter talk about COTY, they always say Monty Williams. They are the ones who decide the awards, not Vegas.

The Jazz were already supposed to be a top 3-4 seed. Yeah they've been INCREDIBLE but they aren't overachieving as much as the Suns are, who may I reminder you are only 3 games behind them.
Getting players to buy in is such a critical coaching skill.
Is Thibs still running starters 40+ mins each?
Yeah its just all the guys are giving it their all, its not like your defensive scheme is that innovative.
Especially when Bron naturally comes with so much offense, that a coach with natural defense would balance it out completely.
That's appropriate criticism as his offenses have never been great throughout his career, but his defenses have always been elite and he's almost always maximized his team's potential going back to his Pacer days led by George/Granger/Stephenson that were a legitimate threat to the Heat.

After the NBA strike-shortened season, they ranked 1st, 1st, 7th and 3rd in defensive rating, struggled the 2 years with the Magic as the team was in flux, but is doing the same thing with the Lakers now (3rd last year and 1st this year).

Vogel is an elite level coach and I'm happy to see him get more recognition that he truly deserves.
Lmao would be hilarious if he brings the GOAT mask even if LeBron didn't play
It gives me life.
Unc is a fad too but he cheers for my team so it's all good!
Ben probably knows that.
it must feel good to know you can shoot as much as you want and expect Ad, Drummond, lebron, or Kuz be there for the rebound
LeRonBurgundy
LeForecast
Most people didn't even have Lakers as the #1 seed to start the season, he exceeded expectations and still didn't get recognised.

[According to this he finished 5th, didn't he?](https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2020/09/2019-20-NBA-Coach-of-the-Year-Award-Voting-Results.pdf)
Snyder’s done fantastic too but as far as the injury luck jazz have had compared to the lakers and what both coaches have done with it it’s a no brainer. Makes me sad to be a lakers fan sometimes, I thought winning a fucking championship would be enough for people to stop shitting on Vogel, but alas, never satisfied, our fan base knows more than a championship coach who made LeBron buy in like he never has to a coach
Give us championships give them useless awards.
Unfortunately yes, and Vogel can't bring it in the dance floor
No team with Lebron is ever going to get looked at for COTY no matter how well they do
this is stupid lol

i think the media's having votes for big time nba awards is not a good system, but the media are integrally important to the nba

you literally watch the games on tv, don't you?

the nba and professional sports do not exist without media coverage
I don't see the Nets getting bounced early if they're healthy. KD any time he wants to can score 40.
Alright bud you won against a non healthy Nets with a non healthy Lakers. Guess you forgot Nets already beat Lakers WITH lebron and gang playing already? and there was no KD either.... I'd be more worried about Lakers making it out the West before anything else.
Kyrie who was ejected, Harden who is out thanks to injury, and KD who is only on his 2nd game back on minutes restriction? So essentially the big 3 were gone...
they played 45 minutes cause it was a blow out.   


The coach literally benched his starts cause they werent gonna win the game.
Half our team is out and we beat them by a lot.

Its a good win.
playing those guys regardless against a Lakers team without AD/Lebron/Kuz (and Gasol I guess) is always going to be a big deal. You can minimize it all you want, but it's still an insane way to lose to a team who's best player is Schroeder (who was also ejected).
hey man I'll take a win since that gets us further from play in (which I don't want AD and LBJ to waste their energy on)
Lol facts. I’m seeing some absolute wild shit like “The Lakers won’t even make it out of the West.”
Yeah except Nets had closed the gap when Kyrie was still in the game. KD kept going back and forth to the bench rather than playing the entire time on his 2nd game back. And the best playmaker Harden was out. They are the big 3 after all. Blake and LMA are not the stars people are trying to claim they are either so there's nothing but an asterisk next to this game. After all, Harden+Kyrie already beat this Lakers team that had Lebron and gang - AD already.
I mean has that really been a question?

It is pretty obvious that the Nets have abysmal role players and no real playmakers outside of Harden and Kyrie. The big 3 have to carry the game.

&#x200B;

And since Harden joined them, it is pretty obvious that their defense is pretty bad. Even when they win and score 130-140 points, the opposite team has like 125-135 points.
I didn’t know a game in April mattered 😂. Nets in 4
But it was a team full of role players.😂 no harden by itself is already bad. Throw in what happened throughout the game. Kd and ky with limited minutes. I know I’ll get down voted every post by laker cock riders but oh well. It’s one game.
That is another game, or two, for lebron to have to play. We have him on contract for a long time, we want peak bron for as long as possible.
This is the most reasonable single comment chain I’ve literally ever seen in this sub.
[deleted]
Callin it now Lakers in 7 against the nuggets off a Jamal Murray miss.
I mean that’s not better for them.
Oh I know. Just pointing out how next level Embiid is playing right now. And I’m a Lakers fan.
fr anyone who would rather play KD, Harden and Kyrie at full strength over the Sixers is crazy lmao
I just want a repeat of 2001 20 years later. Same result, too.
True, but the Nets had a slow start and had already closed the gap they had. If Kyrie hadn't been ejected, no doubt Nets would have overtaken.
>Eh... Dennis was having the better game.

I mean, that's exactly why Irving was so upset and jaw-jacking.  He was getting at least matched by Schroder, and didn't like it.
KD's not a bad playmaker, but having him be the primary one (on a minutes restriction no less) is a bad formula. Nets lack of defense is an issue, sure, but another thing that worries me about them is their lack of playmaking outside of Harden.
Cuz of this loss?
IMO Harden is more important than Jokic and Giannis
probably cause his playoff performances have been questionable but nets don't have the team defense to contain him like the heat and raptors did I think
I guess because giannis has been slowed down by elite playoff defenses. People think all you need is a wall to slow him down, but you need actual defenders which the nets do not have.
Because of his playoff struggles. The Nets theoretically build a wall, but unlike last year there's Jrue Holiday and not Eric Bledsoe out there beside him. Giannis can technically still have some issues in the playoffs but he also might not because of the added help and the Nets having subpar bigs to defend him.
This guy doesn't mathematics
I meant he started 0/4 and was 6/8 since that point
He finally got one against the Kings.
> I honestly think y’all can beat them easily

easily? lol thats delusion. However, the Sixers most definitely could win. So could the Bucks
AD for BI and Lonzo who says no?
wE oVeRpAiD
#WASHEDKING
Exactly. The cavs went from nba finals to 15th in the east with the exact same roster +sexton -lebron
Yeah that's fair lol

I get that people like the idea of going all in on a championship, but you need at least 8 good, healthy players to make it to the finals to begin with. The Lakers have a lot of depth, and a lot of ball handling.
The deal would make no sense for Lakers. They’d be losing 40+ points from those 3 players and good defense who are young for a 35 yr old 6 foot guy who might get 18
Oh for sure. But it's not like they're playing like a playoff team with all their guys out.
Absolutely. If they managed to go .500 without AD and LeBron I would have considered that a success. But right now they’re at 5-6 heading into 4 tough games so we’ll see.
LeBron and maybe like Steph Curry or Dame. Someone decent at shooting. Perhaps could use AD as a backup bench player too.
Nuff said  🔥  🔥  🔥
Did you say that harden is more impactful that Lebron James and Anthony Davis combined???
After reading and commenting here for years I've come to accept that r/nba has a moronic hivemind that downvotes every opinion except one. For some reason the majority of the people in this thread don't realize or accept that the nets had no Harden and lost Kyrie midway through the game.
[deleted]
Yall gotta stop taking what that man says at face value lol. He gets paid to say stupid shit
I will never bet against lebron
Steve Nash DBPM was negative every year of his career except his 2nd season where it was .3
I think we agree, heres a comment I wrote somewhere else in this thread:

 

Imo what makes the nets scary is that they have an identity that goes from the coaching staff down to their 12th man. Their squad is all about offense and they embrace that. When you combine that with talent like Harden, KD, and Kyrie it's enough to make them title favorites against almost any team.

***I think Lebron is the great equalizer in all of this though. If that man can dictate the tempo and flow of the game against those Warriors teams then I dont see why he cant control the game against the Nets. He has enough tools and weapons on the team now to dismantle and dissect the Nets relatively weak defense. I could see Bron averaging a 30 point triple double in a 6 game series against these guys. But the Nets ARE scary tho.***

 Lebron can neutralize other teams' offenses just by doing his thing at his own pace.  He slows it down and it ends with either a bucket for him, an assist or a quality shot at the least.  He has a higher turnover rate but he creates quality looks so consistently it doesnt even matter.  AD is going to be a monster against the Nets too if they face.  They have no answer on either ends for him.
I still think this series would give us a good look at it from a coaching perspective.  Whose schemes will be more effective?  Will the Lakers coast to 5/6 game series win on good defensive schemes or will Lebron and AD gut it out with big performances in a 7 game slug?  I think that narrative could develop.
As a Lebron fan I'll say that Kyrie's defense can be really good when he applies himself there.  He's stronger than people think and it shows when he takes contact at the basket.  At his size and speed he can be a lowkey menace on that end.
Joe Harris competes on that end but in no way is he good. KD is not a good on ball defender and has never been.
I do actually watch. Harden played well on defense his last year for the Rockets but outside of that, he hasn't been interested in investing any energy on that end of the court. The Nets are bleeding points this season. Part of that reason is Harden.
AD will be the 5 in the playoffs
They'll put Durant on Lebron. Durant does a decent job, especially if he gets help. They have nobody who can guard AD. Aldridge and Claxton will try...
I mean we’re missing our actual LeBron and AD and still gave the Nets fits on the inside. Not saying they’re not gonna be great in the postseason, but they do have weaknesses.
So what’s your point?

The Nets beat Philly/Jazz/nuggets this year too without harden dropping 120 in each of those  games. Nets are also missing 2 more guards through injury. I’m just not seeing how the offense is bad without harden....no metric supports it
Lmao don't get so defensive buddy. They had a rough start to the season and all of a sudden "KD can't carry", when he came off an achilles tear. Those first 10 games or so before harden was traded he was still getting himself to form, he's carried the nets to wins like the win against the nuggets without kyrie. Harden has played great but don't act like KD could've done much this game when he was on a minutes restriction and it was second game back after missing 23 games. (Of course I get downvoted even though what I'm saying is true lol)
Honestly other than the 06 Heat it feels like you gotta go back to like the early 80s Lakers or maybe the 83 Sixers but I haven't seen too much film of either. The 87/88 Lakers played great defense but I'd put them behind the Celtics/Pistons/Rockets/Bulls.
I’ve been trying to avoid it, but the Nets have a bunch of star players, good role players, but without Harden they’re just, meh.
Deandre didn’t get any minutes cause he’s butt checks
he must be talking about meth curry
i was told that the league needs parity so they've decided to not to include me in this basketball match
Finally, a sensible take on the Nets' loss.
Don’t get me wrong, I get that, but that is a completely different team. If anything you should have our other game this year...
They still got THT running the offense who’s gonna run Nets’?
For no good reason I might add
Who’s gonna run the offense for the Nets? Harden ain’t playing
What a sad life he must have that he models himself after Skip Bayless
u/FlexFantasyTE sounds like a message for you
For sure
And now with Drum added, my god 😍
I think Gordon could probably do a credible job on one of them, but I dunno who would get the other one.
No team ever has an answer for Bron and AD! 

It's always about trying to enable your own players and while limiting the opposition as much as possible.
I heard murmurs of how AG guards Lebron well? Didnt see any numbers to substantiate it. But LeBron in the playoffs is a different animal.
Gordon is about as good an answer for LeBron as there is in the NBA historically. Nobody can stop him but he’s a 34% career shooter against AG in a pretty big sample (~68 mins of gametime) over the past 4 years.
Tbf you can say that about damn near every team in the league except the Sixers. Ben can guard LeBron and Embiid on AD if we’re talking matchup wise. Except for the sixers I don’t know of any teams that matchup with them.
Aaron Gordon? 


🤭
Gordon on Bron, he’s one of the most effective defenders against him in the league over the past 4 years. LeBron is shooting 34% on like 36 attempts over ~34mins of matchup time. The Lakers have big matchup problems for defending Jokic, MPJ and Murray as well. Porter in particular is a completely different player this year, he was picked on extensively last year. Obviously nobody can really stop LeBron but slowing him down even a little would be a huge boost for Denver, and the Murray-Dennis, MPJ-Kuzma, Jokic-Drummond, and even Barton-KCP matchups are pretty lopsided this time
You’re underrating how much of a mismatch 2021 Jokic and MPJ are for Drummond/Gasol and Kuzma. Gordon is probably a better matchup against LeBron than either of those pairings.
 I think people are confused lol Person you're responding to is saying nuggets, clippers and sixers are the toughest matchups for the lakers and they're right
Ok.
Kuzma v MPJ, Drummond v Jokic, and Murray v Schroeder are all pretty lopsided in the nuggets favor. Gordon is about as good a LeBron slower as there is in the NBA.
Totally, I should be embarrassed to live in the Eastern Sierra, where everyone from around the world comes to visit.
Like 2 players that aren’t even all stars were gonna make the difference and beat us lol this is such a dumb and lazy take
I agree, when the Clippers beat them they were saying "regular season doesn't matter", now suddenly they're rejoicing after a regular season game. Keep the energy up for both sides. Personally I don't really care about the regular season, as it is absolutely meaningless aside from seeding. True teams are made in the playoffs.
Refs must be fun at parties
that's not ejection worthy. that's way too soft. he was just yapping, it's not a big deal. common in the 90s.
Considering we don’t even have a superstar on the court Dennis is pretty impactful. He was matching Kyrie.
And we didn’t have our superstars plus our impactful role players. You serious? Lol
A big one 🤷‍♂️
Let me guess, you’re a big nets fan and have to defend any comment that says they aren’t a perfect team
Yah all that just to lose in 6 rather than 5
Really not. The Jazz are good but how they will defend any other teams all star wing? Who they put on James, Leonard, George, Davis and others? They are as good as last year, but how they manage to play Gobert when he cannot switch on anybody on the floor? They are a second round team, if lucky they could arrive to the WCF, but that was the case also last year.

The Clippers? They are a joke. They aren't good on D and neither on offense, they are worst than last year talent wise and also they had one of the worst coach in the league i don't expect any crazy strategy to change a series.

And the Suns with CP3 are good but no way they are a WCF contender. They are clearly overarching, they don't have the dept to make a deep run the PO and they also miss the experience to perform out there. Remember even the Warriors needed 2 years with early exits in the PO before starting winning, so they are not a really though match for the Lakers.


The only thing that could cause the Lakers this season is the injury of one of their star, either LBJ or AD.

Edit: i forget, the Nuggets with Gordon and McGee are worst than last year with Grant(>Gordon) and Plumlee, so they are 2x weaker now than last year, they lost 4-1 to the Lakers. It could have been a 4-2 i don't expect anything more this year if all healthy.
I guess we'll see. I for one don't see how they can beat the bucks or sixers in a best of 7 matchup.
With all of that they still shouldn’t have lost and that’s the reason for this over-celebration. It’s really not that complicated
Think he just means new team lol.. fake is a lil of a stretch.
The only 2 impressive wins in that stretch was the Suns and Clippers. We still didn’t have AD or Schröder. Calling that “running through the west” is dumb
Yeah 2 good wins. And beat us without AD and Schröder. That’s not “running through” the west lol
With what? 😂
"Extrapolate" losing to the Pistons with a healthy LeBron. It's literally just the regular season, who cares.
Lakers fans accusing Nets fans of band wagonning is the kettle calling the pot black lmao
Even with Harden yall would’ve got roasted with Lebron or AD.

Isn’t leaving by trade is objectively better for team?
its close enough tho tbf. but i agree its just one game, lakers had us this time we had them earlier in the season thats just the way it goes
Weird thoughts
Sixers do not have 2 superstars. If you think simmons pg are on davis harden kd tier then lol
He's the most valuable player in the league just because he left his shitty team and didn't want to keep losing doesn't mean he's not
While we didn’t have AD and Schröder.
Prolly, but I stand by the fact that it’s all about the three point field goals!
Yeah, he now looks like an actual NBA bench player. He's older than Giannis, so it's kinda surprising he's improved so much at such a late age. I think he's probably topping out as a bench player though.

Just goes to show you how much raw talent is in that family, and wouldn't blame teams if they kept giving Kostas chances to see if he can make a sudden leap too.
His motor has always been the thing that could help keep him in the league. He was too overeager with the Knicks whenever he got minutes but has definitely figured out how to play a bit more in control. Glad he’s getting minutes!
I mean we also had 6-7 players  out from injury, one ejected, and he stilled played 2 minutes apparently
Naw bro lol...

Having potential is one thing and being a G league player is another.
Ah okay
Oh I see nice thanks
Nope but I’m interested in getting tips.
Wait, that's why he was eating carrots!? I have to watch that again, it's been a while. Pretty good from what I remember.
And I don't understand how so many people did not understand or believe in the idea of Drummond being good for the Lakers.
Exactly. At the worst, they have another big body to make things difficult for Gobert, Joker, and Nurkic in the playoffs. At best, he’s a rebounding machine, that dominates the glass on both ends and gets you double figures without running too many plays for him.  Great pick up.
This is why buyouts are BS
FYI Drummond was never a 1st/2nd option in Detroit or Cleveland
Cause, get buckets youngblood
I see. I'm still the only person I've seen at a blackjack table play basic strategy. I actually memorized all the hands. Your odds of winning are still 49%, but its better than doing something crazy like staying on a 16 when the dealer shows a 10.
Apparently it releases the same chemicals in the brain that cocaine does.. so theres that.

Edit:  Needless to say I love me some cocaine.
Tony Brothers T'd a coach for staring at him. They need to be stopped. MFers are gonna start stealing the balls and blocking shots of dudes they don't like just for the fuck of it like, "We union, bitch."
Way too much lol
Looks like this was what happened:

Why can't you believe it lol? I agree harden makes role players look much better
Sure but he was also going back and forth to the bench the entire game. This was literally his first game as a starter and only his 2nd game coming back into rotation. Of course, he's not going to gel fully well just yet.
Cringe
Us and the Clippers haven’t really had that same energy though until last year basically. For most of our history it’s been more of a big brother/little brother thing.
That exactly parallels the origin of the Beat LA chant though!
And who coached them up? And where Hibbert at now? Lmao
Why do you keep slamming Hill in this thread. At best he was their 4th best player in 2013
I mean, I get the memes about Paul George now. But early on before his injury he was a problem. He was key in those series.
And West. Respectable squad tbh.
They were a decent squad but they weren’t anything talent wise compared to Miami.
He took HibbertCoin to the moon
Plus he doesn't need to worry about culture too much with Lebron around so he can just coach.
Still bagholding my Hibbertcoin.
Didn’t PG fuck his wife or something and it messed with his confidence?
Yeah Vogel coached them in the regular season too
ain't dudley usually out even when he's healthy?
He was exhausted from that game 5, don’t think it was a choke. He’s just not LeBron who’s an alien when it comes to how often he can put max effort and be fine the next game
I got a comment I wrote about 2 weeks ago saying the same thing lol, Jimmy isn’t the guy he was painted out to be at all
Rondo suggested picking up Butler full court. They made a concerted effort to get him gassed and it worked
Kuz was in a unique position because of how he was drafted. A decent floor with a good ceiling at a bargain price. We all shit talked him, but, he put in the work and he just wanted it that bad.
kuzma REALLY didn’t want to get traded.  he realized that the lakers had no use for an inefficient volume shooter, so he did whatever he could to find a role on the team.
I dont k ow who it was, but someone made him realize scoring alone doesn't make you a champion, defense and rebounds sure will tho
> Theoretically a player could grow a 6' Afro and block everything

Is this the new NBA meta ‽ What have you done . . . . . .
It's weird, even if he somehow didn't know the cap exactly, literally every team has guys on the staff who are literally there to understand the cap rules to ensure nothing is done wrong.

Way too much risk involved in not having it
But those teams didn't win a championship so that was actually a failure, see?
Seriously, the Vogel slander during that time was crazy. The 2013-14 Pacers had an adjusted defensive efficiency rating of 110.2 (third best of all time) and an adjusted defensive rating of 107.45 (14th best of all time). Individual player talent can only take you so far when it comes to developing some of the most suffocating defenses in NBA history.
Rob nodding up and down like “you’re goddamn right!” when Bron says “Rob wants his damn respect.”

So hilarious how turnt he was.
Well those people who protested called it a strike so... I guess they think being a Lakers fan is a full time job.

We’re the most spoiled fan base. Lebron James comes here and you have the audacity to *complain*? Like come on now.

We’ve only had a few bad seasons in our entire history. Everybody (including the Celtics) would kill to have what we’ve had since 1980.
Yeah it was more of a protest but the organizers called it a strike which made it even worse.
I’m just using the diction they used, which made it even more ridiculous.
Yeah that’s fair. I’d say that he was impressive in Indiana, and thought it was unfair to talk about his time in Orlando without bringing up the injuries.
“I don’t care what the betting odds are, here’s my personal anecdote of what I remember reporters saying”

Every conversation I’VE heard reporters having about this has Snyder clearly one and Williams in second, but clearly you have a special level of insight
Makes me wonder if Larry and his 3 year rule about coaching was right
The speed and accuracy with which they recover after so many switches (especially when doubling stars like harden or KD) indicate a lot more than "guys giving it their all." It's a defensive coach's job to help guys communicate and coordinate on switches as efficiently as possible and they've done a damn good job of that. Obviously effort matters a lot in all facets of the game, but you don't get to be the top defense in the league just by trying hard.
Yeah that’s what I was implying
we were like 25-2 or something outrageous, that team was unreal
For sure, after the AD trade there were only like 4 players on the roster lol. Vogel and Pelinka did a hell of a job building an excellent team around Lebron and AD.
I remember most people on the preseason rankings podcast by The Ringer picked the Lakers finishing like 4th at best and losing in the second round
Jazz, Clippers, Bucks were all ahead of us. Even Rockets iirc.
“Makes me sad to be a lakers fan sometimes” 

You lost me here. Vogel should be a COY front runner tho, but don’t downplay snyder getting these kind of results on a team with zero superstars, and imply (laughably) that there’s some kind of anti lakers media bias
didn't brown wind coty?
I feel very good about our chances of making the finals. You haven’t seen a full strength Lakers squad yet. Lebron will be nice and rested. AD will have a chip on his shoulder and something to prove. Lakers are built for the playoffs with lots of depth. People doubted them last year too  I like our chances.
[deleted]
Kyrie got schroder ejected too, who was having an impressive game in the first half and setting the tone for the whole team. His loss was at least equal or greater than kyrie. Drummond also played less minutes than KD, on his second game back from injury. Lakers were also missing Kuz and Marc who have been holding it down when AD and Bron are out. This game was pretty fair and Nets just got outplayed.
no they played 45 mins cus Kyrie got ejected and KD is on minutes restrictions cus its his second game back from injury
Yeah but they were responding to this:

>Lakers won by 25 with the end of their bench over Kyrie and KD.

Which isn't true really
Sure only because Nets big 3 weren't able to play fully for multiple reasons. This Nets team without KD already beat a much healthier Lakers team that had Lebron minus AD.
It's definitely a good win, you guys should be proud, sure. It's just that I think the teams on court were kinda evenly matched. I wouldn't look at what the Nets had on court and think that would be a sure W
Don't want to minimize, I kinda thing you guys are undervaluing your team. It's definitely a good win, you guys played hard, your coach is better, and they can play without the other guys, the defense was amazing. 

I just don't look at what the Nets had on court most of the second half and think "that's a sure win for them, how the fuck are they losing".
Lol Kyrie in the game with KD there was suppose to trash this Lakers team. All your takes are so stupidly ass kissing these Nets team combine with your hate with LeBron. SMH.
People have been saying for weeks that the Nets have elite role players and above league average defense though (in the last stretch of games). Every Nets post-game thread had comments like this.
Until they actually win something together, I would cool with it the overhype.
full of role players? yeah for the Lakers duhhh. You making an excuse coz theres no Harden? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It’s crazy that 36 year old Bron is “peak”
It’s about as good as it’ll get lmao
I guess pot is calling the kettle black considering you're the same damn thing except for some reason you let 1 commenter get under you skin that you're spamming replies to him lmao.
That's still a good result for the Nuggets... means they'll be contending for years to come. Glad they got that Gordon trade done.
The Nets got ahead at some point in the 2nd quarter and the Lakers went back up quickly. It's not like the Nets were in their best spot right before the ejection.
When Dennis was ejected he had scored more than Kyrie and Lakers were still up by four yet somehow there would be no doubt the Nets would have won?
No doubt? 

I agree that anything could have happened. I can’t agree with “no doubt”. Kyrie is a gifted offensive player, but a sub-par defender and Dennis exposed him more than once. Definitely up in the air if both had been in.
Honestly with how the shooting went I doubt it. It would've been a little closer but that 2nd half was brutal. I still think this says more about supporting casts and defense more than anything else. If the Big 3 aren't there or at close to peak level, they can't rely on their support level guys whereas LA can to an extent because their defense keeps them in games allowing them to be competitive.

Denver would struggle to make the playoffs without Jokic. Kyrie and Durant would figure it out without Harden.
Whoops I'm dumb lol
It would be amazing if he shot so well that two of those early misses were magically changed to makes. You said he started off 0-4 and that guy then thought you said "but he finished with only two misses" 😂
I’m way more comfortable putting money on a team that controls the paint verse a perimeter team
Which AD
UP UP and AWAY!!
I'd be very disappointed/surprised if we don't win the next 3 games. I think the only way we lose them is if we go extremely cold from the 3 point line, or someone important gets ejected from the game. But no matter what record we get without LBJ and AD, i'm proud of the team because they fought hard. As long as we make the playoffs, idc where we land in the standings. In the end, a team has to beat LBJ and AD 4 times, and i don't see that happening.
Did you not see the word most? I think most people can infer I'm talking about everyone except AD and Lebron.
Is that what you had tell yourself that when Nets were carving up the west?
Where in my comment did I say I was taking him seriously lol? I watch clips from his show because it’s comedic gold.
As Morey said, defensive stats leave much to be desired.


Still, what happens when you account for  average or slight plus team defender along with a sub par individual defender ?
> Lebron can neutralize other teams' offenses just by doing his thing at his own pace.  He slows it down and it ends with either a bucket for him, an assist or a quality shot at the least.  He has a higher turnover rate but he creates quality looks so consistently it doesnt even matter.  AD is going to be a monster against the Nets too if they face.  They have no answer on either ends for him.

The thing about those Warriors was that they didn't have 3 iso scorers on the level of the Nets. And I don't know how much it matters that LeBron can "slow it down" because Harden does that exact same thing.


In terms of talent this Nets squad is unmatched by any in NBA history and any attempt to downplay their strength is just misguided.

https://www.nba.com/stats/articles/the-importance-of-kevin-durants-defense
Lmao you didn't watch then, hes been good on defense for years. You guys are just stuck in 2014. Letting a play or two a game but locking up and being a top 3 in steals player when you are averaging the most efficient 35+(36.6) season of all time and averaging 40-7-7 for 50 games all while actually playing 99% of the games available to play, isn't a valid argument son.
Maybe in crunch time but I doubt during most of the game. They need a big body for people like Jokic and Gobert for playoffs
I can tell you from watching last year's playoffs that Vogel won't just default to that lineup. He'll go with Drummond (or Gasol) at center and *if* those guys are getting played off the floor then he'll go to AD there. But just look at [Game 1 against Houston last year:](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/202009040LAL.html) Javale started and he and Dwight combined for 24 minutes. The Lakers lost that game, but in the next game even though Javale started again, he and Dwight only got a combined 8 minutes (all Javale as Dwight didn't play again in the series until the last few minutes of garbage time in Game 5). Game 3 it was down to 6 minutes, and in Game 4 it was zero. 

Vogel is gonna make the other team prove that the normal lineup doesn't work before he starts changing things. If the Lakers play the Nets, Vogel is gonna make Brooklyn have to prove that having Drummond out there is bad for the Lakers before Vogel switches things up.
I think very unlikely, may be at key points but they just need another Dwight and Javelee which we have, Drummond and Gasol
AD shoots a lot of jump shots, it's not like he's a punisher down there. They'll single cover him and hope that he doesn't hit too many shots.
They’ve also gotten absolutely demolished by the Jazz and 6ers before, and still have one more match up against Denver, so there’s no consistency there. And according to Power Rankings Guru, the Nets have had the absolute easiest schedule in the entire NBA so far.
100% lol, the team without Harden is lackluster, its a completely different team without him vs with him lol

He won't win MVP but he's 100% the MVP FOR the Nets, he spoonfeeds everyone on the team lol
True. But I thought that this specific game would get my point across better. Nets were severely undermanned, and yet still beat the championship Lakers squad from last year. Yet we know that if the two teams as they were that game went head to head, Nets wouldn't have stood a chance.
Kevin Durant?
This is like bottom of the barrel excuse. Just stop scrapping.
Did you know that Irving had 0 assists? Schroder had 4, basically running the team
Don’t matter lol THT is a rookie who rarely runs the offense. Nets lost their 2nd best player while still having KD and Lakers lost their best player on the court
The Lakers main playmakers are LeBron and Schroder. If Brooklyn only has two guys who can do that then maybe that's an issue.
I’m not understanding the hate. I like the Lakers. I was just stating the obvious to the guy who sarcastically said “I thought the Nets were unbeatable.” Its a completely different team when you’re missing those fellas who made them “unbeatable” to begin with. Harden has been a big reason for their success. It would be no different than someone talking smack about the Lakers when their missing their core group of players like they currently are. Completely diff team when AD and Bron are healthy. I don’t know what was so controversial about that.

Edit: no response as expected
LeBron is a different animal in the playoffs. Gordon doesn't stand a chance.
You may be right. But I would still say that the advantage AD + Bron has over the Nuggets is much bigger than Jokic has over the Lakers
If Kuzma ends up in the starting lineup he'll be playing shooting guard, as Drummond, AD and LeBron would be in the frontcourt. And you are *way* overstating how effective Gordon is at slowing down LeBron 😂
You guys said this same thing last year
Wow!
Uhhh bam was an allstar last year and dragic in 2018. Great nba knowledge, wouldn't expect anything less from a Lakers fan🤣
The Lakers are one of them.
Harden is everything for them. KD + Kylie is good but. adding harden is adding a basically 3 time MVP that solves all of the ball handling problems and baits a fuckton of fouls is absolutely enormous for them.
Yes and since the 90s we’ve had some of the biggest brawls in the NBA because yapping was allowed to continue.

This was a regular season game, not playoffs and Kyrie was acting like a punk.


I have no idea why Dennis was given the second tech tho.
The 90s were 30 years ago.  Just sayin
Take from it what you want. I was giving you context. Seems like you're being offended over a factual statement.
I have no clue what you are trying to say.
Each to their own but I do not trust the sixers in the playoffs. They still depend on a guy in Simmons who can’t shoot and gets exposed in the playoffs. Same goes for giannis. Nets he s too much firepower for my liking to be stopped if they are healthy. Maybe things are different this year now bucks have Hoilday but have to see to believe it
They are supposed to win without 70 percent of their cap playing in the 2nd half?
Who cares they lost a game they had no business losing that happens in the nba. It’s completely irrelevant over the course of a long season
They are 17-6 against the west with wins over jazz, clippers +2, nuggets and Lakers. They also beat blazers on the road and swept the road trip. If that’s. Not running the west I don’t know what is
Losing obviously lol
Yeah we shouldn’t have lost that game and got clowned for it just as they should for this loss
Lol because one of the best NBA franchises in one of the biggest markets is more likely to have bandwagoners than a newly formed superteam that never accomplished anything? Okay bud
Wym?
Yeah, you'll be good when you won't even make it out of the west.
atleast I'm replying to multiple people but you're quite obsessed with me? Is it cause I'm hitting you where it hurts huh? Cause it sure looks like it. I know truth hurts hence why you are trying so hard to spam me lmao.
Not when the trade happens after you’ve already built a team for that year around said player. Also a free agent has 0 obligations to any team si there’s nothing negative about leaving.
We have the best superstar duo, but we’re not the only one
The “shitty team” that he kept building and failing with? Lol he is not MVP
And KD was out as well...
The only sudden leap they are expecting in regards to Kostas is the leap Giannis might be willing to make to go to their team. 

I doubt these teams would continue giving contracts to Kostas and Thanasis if Giannis suddenly left the league, even if they are/can be decent bench players.
They’re talking about Thanasis, who’s on the Bucks and plays ~20mpg rn.
Thanasis is not a G league player
I think its free on Tubi. Its about a murderer who covers up their off screen Adderall addiction by eating a bunch of carrots- i think, its been a minute
Nah I'm joking about that but it has to be? No? Carrots don't do that! It was way better than it had any business being lol
Pretty sure they were bot accounts set up by Marc Gasol.
Because his whole career he tried to be the #1 option and WOULD NOT take a backseat, even when Sexton and Garland were clearly the 1 and 2 on the team. Plus his career numbers are atrocious for efficiency. So people thought there was no way he'd buy in on the Lakers.
I mean, he literally played 2 games and in a completely different lakers. We'll seen when they're all back together. It's stupid to reach conclusions after a single game
Because once the narrative is set in stone it's a karma drain to disagree
Because he has one of the lowest TS% in the league who is supposed to be a dominant paint option. Let’s hold off on acting like he’s a great pick-up after a few games
You're not wrong. Bum deal for buyout teams (disproportionately small markets) for sure. Don't know enough to opine on solutions, but hope the league changes something.
He sure tried to take shots like he was tho
Damn go to vegas and clean em out bro
Yeah right? These ass refs needs to get fined for every stupid call they make they're screwing teams and screwing the games for the fans
thank you
That reason alone would make me despise the Lakers if I were a Clippers fan haha. 

I kind of feel a little bad for the Clippers situation. They can’t get the love as a small market team because you’re still in LA. But no matter how well they build their roster in the draft, or trades, free agents (most of the time) will still choose the Lakers over their team just because it’s the Lakers. Imagine if the lob city core was on the Lakers during their prime years. Free agents would be flocking there on a discount like crazy.
Hill was extremely important to those 2 ECF runs. A steady presence at PG
Respectable is a tad soft a word for a 60-win 1-seed with multiple All-Stars that made back to back conference finals
Top end sure, but indy had better players 4-8 probably.
The fuck u hear this at?  Conversation at a bus stop?
Are you sure?
idk. To me that sounds like excuses. When LeBron was around the same age as Jimmy he choked in the finals against Dallas, and people rightly criticized him for that. Wasn't he "tired" too?
Then why didn't he let someone else bring it up?
kuzma shittalking has now turned into a meme.  everyone on his ig is trying to be a god damn comedian
I think we’ll finally see peak LeBron with a crisp hairline and a crazy 6’ fro.

The King finally gets his crown.
if you ain't first you're last
I hear you there.
Ok see you back here in 2 months
It’s a weird thing for him to say because he and his teammates bought into KC Jones for several years.
I appreciate you doing that, I know as a Warriors fan you know what an elite (I’m pretty sure one year y’all had an all-time too?) defense looks like, so I know I’m not being a compete homer haha
24-3, the fact Vogel wasnt in the top 5 was fucking hilariously dumb by the media
[Then there was Chris Mannix predicting the Lakers would miss the playoffs entirely](https://youtu.be/vObvW9nNuXE?t=3m12s) 🤦🏿‍♂️
And then, at the end of the season, those guys were all like "of course the Lakers won, they have Lebron and AD!"
I’m a lakers fan but tampa born and raised couldn’t miss the opportunity to have a tampa flair
Yeah that was before Lebron was seen as a one man team. Brown's competition Phil Jackson had two stars in Kobe and Pau. Brown only had one. COTY is a joke of an award. Just look at that stretch of award winners. Sam Mitchell, Byron Scott, Mike Brown, Scott Brooks.
No one doubted you at all? Lakers were one of the top predicted runner ups to the finals other than the Clippers before their 3-1 collapse....
Says the one who's spamming the same comment himself hahah.
Laker role players were probably just better than Nets role players this game. Kyrie was definitely the best player on the court, Blake and LMA played well off him. When he was gone, their playmaker was gone and I would say Kyrie was the more impactful player that was missing.
>  was it really that big of a deal?
> Sure only because Nets big 3 weren't able to play fully

The 45 minutes they got out of KD and Kyrie are 45 more minutes than the Lakers got out of LeBron and AD
This Lakers team is also completely different than it was in the earlier game.  Also they didn’t have any interior presence with AD out but now they had a guy in Drummond
Sure and their fans were probably happy about that win.

Im happy with this win
[deleted]
> It's just that I think the teams on court were kinda evenly matched. 

So then which adds a bigger boost to a team: getting Harden back or getting LeBron *and* AD back?
True.

Thats a good thing. Teams looked evenly matched and a majority of our starting lineup was out.
[removed]
The line was Nets -10.5, this was expected to be a blowout and I think even most Lakers fans thought the same thing.
Lakers fans don't want to admit it that this game has a huge asterisk next to it so they are downvoting lol.
Umm no.

I think the consensus has been that adding Griffin and LMA should improved their defense which it has.

&#x200B;

And the Nets have very good 3 pt shooters in Harris and Green, but as it turns out you need a good ball handler aka Harden to get good shots.

If anything this game showed how vital Harden is for them.

Last night was an off night for them just like it was an off night for the Lakers or do you think that going forward Lakers are going to be shooting 55% going forward?

&#x200B;

Post game threads are reactionary AF. Take those comments with a grain of salt.
My comment still stands. I see nothing but LeCock in everyone’s mouth but I can’t say nets in 4?
Yeah...your one of them🤡
[deleted]
Yep great result after the lakers decline it’s nuggets time. Especially if MPJ continues on the route he’s on.
Yeah, but that was also when KD had joined back in so they KD and Kyrie would have been playing together atleast at the beginning of the 3rd quarter.
Reason I say no doubt is because KD entered at the end of the 2nd quarter to start the 3rd and with along with Kyrie who was already closing the gap would have most likely along with KD overtaken.
Then you haven't been watching the Nets games this year. Kyrie is actually having a peak season right now playing the best he ever has and his defense has actually been much better than people think. 

Reason I say no doubt is because KD entered at the end of the 2nd quarter to start the 3rd and with Kyrie who was already closing the gap would have most likely along with KD overtaken.
The 2nd half where Kyrie was ejected at the beginning? I mean of course, it was going to be brutal when the best Nets player tonight was ejected. Also, Blake and LMA play better off the other 3 especially Harden and sometimes Kyrie. On their own sure, but if Nets primary playmakers are in there, they won't collapse. Not to mention Joe Harris and Claxton.
Thanks little girl.
Luka too
So good they erased earlier misses!
Don’t worry, it was phrased strangely to be fair.
Nah not u lol I was like how can u go 0-4 then be 6-8 thats not possible lol
The one where a net total exchange of eyebrows would be 3
I guess I still don’t know what to expect with Drummond and mclemore because it’s too early to tell but last night’s game was a good start. Maybe it’s a blessing in disguise that AD and LBJ are out so the other guys could get some reps.

The show is one of the best entertainment available right now.
> The thing about those Warriors was that they didn't have 3 iso scorers on the level of the Nets.

True. It's the whole reason they went all out to get KD after losing to the Cavs. It's also worth pointing out they had pre-Achilles KD, and their team defense was much better, so I don't know how to compare the two squads.
Not against the nets though
True true, same way that dwight affected jokic last season.
This one is correct answer
He played 60% of his minutes at the 5 last playoffs
Agreed on the schedule part. Been largely facing bummy teams last 20ish games with a lot of close/ lucky wins
Last time the Lakers didn’t have even a back up playmaker they lost 4 in a row despite having LeBron.

Imagine playing without one.
Slowing him down more than other players would is still a significant advantage. And we don’t know how well LeBron will recover from this injury- a high ankle sprain basically ended Peyton Manning’s career at a similar age. Obviously LeBron is a freak of nature when it comes to recovery time, but there’s still quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding him
Yeah, Lakers are definitely favored if AD and Bron are both 100%, probably heavily. But if either one isn’t in form it could be a problem for them. Even last year that series was a buzzer beater away from going to 6 and the Nuggets are way better now
LeBron is shooting 34% vs Gordon over years worth of matchup data, about 68mins of game time
I don’t know anyone who thought we were going to beat the Lakers last year, and this is if AD and LeBron aren’t 100%
Thanks man!
One time all stars because of injuries lol and I knew that but they’re not perennial all stars. They were gonna lose even fully healthy but whatever makes you haters feel better
I mean keep up the energy for both times, make it either regular season games don't matter or celebrate regular season championships. Can't use one only
He's saying that the regular season doesn't matter because the Jazz don't show up in the playoffs. 

Not that I agree with him but yeah, that's what he's saying.
In terms of team shooting the warriors in their prime were a better team with more varied tactical offensive schemes, and a true off ball game.
Against an injury riddled Laker team without their 2 superstars, yes
I mean Lakers were without 90% of their cap
If that’s the case then why even watch regular season games? And why talk to anyone in the post game threads like you are? That narrative is only used when it’s the team you didn’t want to win smh
That’s a better indication than the road trip. All I’m saying was that 5 game stretch was not running through the west like everyone said it was
I genuinely don't care about the loss 😂
Why were the Nets assumed to win this game? Lakers were touted as the best bench in the league this season and the Nets as one of the worst. With all the injuries and ejections, its battle of the benches and LA is highly favored.

Wouldn’t say when three of your closest people in team leaves, that team is built for you.
“Nothing negative about leaving”
Yes Cleveland was doing fantastic after he left
2021 Rockets are not the same team as previous years. They're one of the worst teams in the league without Harden
That’s the benefit of having 3 superstars smh
Thanasis definitely earned another 1-2 year deal after this season, hes playing well on a contender
Oh gotcha, as you can tell I was confused about the whole role player escalation talk 😂
Thanks!
I feel like we had these exact same worries about dwight last year.
I think it's fair to say.

I'm not saying he's gonna be a great player but honestly for how cheap he is I don't think he hurts any contending team especially if that team is bad at rebounding.

He has his flaws of course I'm not denying any of that but I really do not think he will be a negative on that team or most teams for that matter. I would've loved to have him in Toronto.

I agree with both of you though. It's too early to say how good he will actually be but I believe it's fair to say even before he got there he wasn't going to be a negative asset. That's just my opinion on it tho
8/15 is pretty good
Next bargaining agreement im sure
He was 3rd on our team in USG%. That was still too much though
I've lived there lol. No cleaning was done.
Seriously. It feels gross complaining about them but it is the worst I've ever seen it. Just all kinds of bullshit calls for because they feel like it.
np
Part of it is their own doing, they know they'd get a whole lot more love if say, they shifted over to Seattle or something. But even as LA's C team (UCLA basketball takes second place in LA imo...well, the Sparks have also won chips...maybe D team) they rake in more money than they would if they were elsewhere apparently.
Still not as important as PG or west


I’m a heat fan. We did not fear george hill. We feared Hibbert, PG, and West in that order
yes but on paper they were nothing when compared to the Heatles
Here on Reddit. There were posts about it.
PG told him
This might be a Carson wentz nick foles situation
There’s a difference between Jimmy and LeBron. Jimmy was clearly exhausted after G5, you saw him almost fall off. Lebron is a freak of nature lol.

Why would Jimmy suddenly “choke” in G6 when he played an amazing G5? There was no pressure on him, we pushed y’all to 6 with an injured Bam and no Dragic so we exceeded expectations already.

Lebron has had all the pressure in the world on him since 2003
Hey man, I completely understand where you're coming from but I'd see this as something to celebrate about LeBron instead of something to drag Jimmy for. Jimmy had to will his team the same way LeBron frequently does and was exhausted, that shows how impressive it is that LeBron is able to do it so much!
I think it's easier if you're winning.
Again, Lebron. Not taking anything away from Vogel, but Lebron takes a lot of credit and a lot of blame on any team he’s on. It might not be right, but it is
Lol fucking clown
Comment replies are great on that vid
Yea that became the narrative real quick for all the haters. Wemt from having a joke of a team to having a team thats to good.
No one expects another prime LeBron
Oh come on - not to stop the circlejerk here but [betting odds put the clippers and the lakers basically neck and neck to win the title.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2020_preseason_odds.html)

This revisionist grievance narrative is nauseating.
My bad, edited my comment with more shortly after typing
I can respect that
Hahaha Scott Brooks won? I totally forgot. Total fucking joke of an award. They should rename it after him so everyone remembers
Most analysts had the Lakers as a 3-5th seed.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I agree, just funny seeing the hot takes.
 Ure so sad LOL same exact comment
 Sure only because Nets big 3 weren't able to play fully for multiple reasons. This Nets team without KD already beat a much healthier Lakers team that had Lebron minus AD.
I’m still in Cloud 9 from that championship. Sorry your team got smacked in the WCF and couldn’t play the Heat.
There’s no asterisk. A win is a win.
Not really. Given history, it's extremely unlikely that the Nets will have all 3 marquee players available and in prime health across the span of the playoffs. 

What we just witnessed was a team, not at full strength, and missing a GOAT -  completely destroy their interior defense. I'd be worried if all my eggs were in the Brooklyn basket. 

The actual question to be asking is why a KD + Kyrie combo couldn't get it done in the first half against players that rarely see starter minutes? That has to be a concern.
I feel bad for the Nets they cant salvage this game and their fans picking up all the excuses they can. How low can they go damn
he he he

&#x200B;

you're 23 and type like this. I think you need an education before you reply. Go watch Nemo bro.
Theorycrafting fun for ya?
I don’t think you know what “no doubt” means...
Kyrie or not, going 0-14 from 3 is brutal. Him being there won't change the fact they missed a ton of shots while the Lakers didn't which skewed the score. Like I said, if he was there, sure it would've been closer but he alone wasn't making up that difference. Also, KD is still out there, that's enough. Saying support players obviously play better with stars is like saying water is wet. The bigger issue is what happens when those guys are gassed or aren't available due to injury or foul trouble or ejection. These things occur and that's why my takeaway from the game is the supporting cast is still very suspect, particularly because they don't play enough defense to cover their other flaws. If Drummond and Schröder are giving Aldridge and Kyrie problems, what's gonna happen when they hit an Embiid and Simmons or Giannis and Jrue?
[deleted]
Dame too
agreed
[removed]
So your happiness is trying to reply back to my multiple comments to defend your Lakers? Not even multiple people, just me. lmao.
Some high standards you've got there.
Yeah but these Nets have Harden (to me he is better than MVP Steph but you are a Warriors fans so agree to disagree) and Kyrie who is much better atm than he was 2016 and 2017.

I find it hard for them to lose to anyone.
They’ll get bounced by philly or the bucks.
Drummond is significantly less effective against Jokic than Dwight historically. Dwight is way more pestery and can jump around Jokic in a way Drummond isn’t athletic enough to do
Yeah but that's cuz they played the small ball Rockets, and then were fine with AD on Jokic, Nurkic, and Bam. If they play the Nets, u figure they want to go big and have AD on KD, Drummond on Aldridge
Thats because Dwight nor Javele were good enough to contain Jokic or Bam, but Drummond is was better than both those guys and if he needs a break, Gasol will fill in that spot
Right, so for me analytically it’s hard to gauge just how good their offense without Harden truly is since it’s been so inconsistent against even trash teams. And looking at it from a best-of perspective, there’s still a lot of things to exploit. Either way, if the Lakers/Nets meet up in the Finals, it’ll be one of the most exciting and talent-filled Finals I’ve seen in a HOT minute lol.
Because that playmaker happens to be the 3rd best player on the team while also missing AD? Its like if Nets had KD without Kyrie and Harden playing
If there's anyone that can overcome this type of injury it's Bron. I'm not concerned at all. I'd be worried if I were a nuggets fan if I had to face the Lakers in the first round. Probably the worst possible scenario for them.
His is only a grade 1
Not a hater, it's a common opinion that there was not much competition last year.
No one is going to change anyone else's mind here.  Hopefully we see these two teams actually play eachother at some point where it matters; we still have a while until it counts.
Lakers were down 70 in the second half,  nets 78 if we are being more specific
Lmao what? Obviously all results matter but the outcome has no impact n what will happen in the future. Bad losses are normal in a long season and there are different factors on why it happens. People always read too much into them which is foolish
They still swept a west road trip without KD so they should be given credit for that
Well you should care that Durant is probably gonna get injured in playoffs
Yeah totally seems like it lol
When are Lakers touted as one of the best benches in the league? Lol I think we have a good bench, but that is very rarely “touted”. We constantly get clowned for being trash when our stars are out.
Jazz, Clippers, Suns, Nuggets, and even the TrailBlazers will have better chances than the Lakers will lmao. Atleast these teams have shooters lmao.
You won the game with a huge asterisk just like the mickey mouse ring you got last season.
That’s literally not his problem or obligation in any way.
Harden was the one asking for stars and then failing to deliver. Asked for Dwight, then CP3, then Russ. After all those failures just to demand a trade to a superteam. That’s not an MVP
I'd think he still needs to remain consistent for the rest of the season, but he's certainly on that trajectory
That's a good concept, but we need to see it. Nothing really changed yet. I too think he can be great IF he adopts the role
Highest USG in cavs tho
> Hibbert

Verticality
Hibbert was a menace
Wade’s knees were declining too, so it wasn’t peak Wade anymore but still impressive they pushed us to 7
Thanks, I enjoyed those
That was so infuriating to hear after a whole year of hearing them getting clowned on NBA Radio.
Those are betting odds, what they’re talking about is espn rankings
Gotcha, wasn’t at all implying that there is anti lakers bias, was talking about how are fans will always hate everyone on our team no matter what, and that COTY is picked based pretty much 100% off record, and not how you do with personnel
Except they were #1? This is some revisionist history lol.
I guess you don't read. One of the top doesn't automatically mean #1.
Except for the time they beat Lakers with Lebron playing? So much for your king?
Yea, thats always going to happen in post game threads.
[deleted]
That game was also missing Schröder, who as we saw can easily pick apart a “switch everything” defense
[deleted]
Chill nephew, you literally started posting on /r/lakers after lebron joined.
Ehhh I disagree, but sure a win is a win.
Ok, so did you have a hot take when Nets without KD already beat Lakers with Lebron and gang - AD the last time? Are Lakers in trouble? 

KD who is only on his 2nd game back on minute restrictions is who you're trying to get a got take off of? Let me guess were you also spouting "there's only 1 ball when Harden first got traded?

Nets had a slow start probably due to the same issue they have when they play against lesser teams. They don't play as serious until the very end. That's why alot of the Nets games are won by a few points. They play up or down to their competition. Seeing Lakers without their best players probably made them not try as hard until they did. By the 2nd half, they had already closed the gap and would have already taken over if Kyrie wasn't ejected. And KD couldn't stay in the game the entire time due to his minutes so it happens.
[deleted]
Not as fun as the theories from Lakers fans.
KD being out there doesn't mean he will automatically be playing at his highest on his 2nd game back. Also, the same can be said for the Lakers. You're assuming Nets will be injured or gassed when the Lakers can have the same issues. Nets aren't going to have to have all their stars sit down, when they can rotate them. You're kind of forgetting Nets have already carved through the West and beat these other teams already in the season before. And this was before Blake and Aldridge were picked up. Like I said, Drummond and Schroder had a good night but they aren't consistent superstars like Kyrie is. LMA will probably trade minutes with Claxton who has shown he can play well.
Yes cause your comment was so intelligent by calling me a noob. I'm starting to think you're in middle school. I forgot what sub I was in.
With Dame is interesting because he cant control pace of the game well enough to be a System player. 

But other teams defensive System vs him has been constant. Hard hedge trap defense. That's why Por have good reps vs that defense. 

But yeah this one is hard one. I would say yes but not at traditional way.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Well they just lost to the lakers C team..
Nah, they're getting Jimmy-ed
As much as I want that to happen, its Kd/Harden/Kyrie. I'll never count that trio out.
Tbh I don’t think so. They’ll get to the finals
Oh lawd, if you think Drummond is a better defender than Dwight...
Dwight was significantly more effective against Jokic than Drummond is likely to be. Nobody really shuts Jokic down but Dwight pesters him better than really anyone
Wdym? They’ve been facing trash teams with harden is my point. The last 20 games with harden and kyrie the net rating was like 5.4. Meaning a lot of close lucky wins. You also have to note that like 80% of the NBA is made up of bad teams. There’s like 3 or 4 teams in the league who play some sort of defense
Probably. But he’s also 36 and that’s basically the most serious non-ligament injury. The Nuggets are also the worst possible scenario for the Lakers in the first round lol. We were completely gassed last year after two 7 game series and it was still closer than anyone else played LA.
I know, but that’s still the type of injury you can make worse by coming back too soon, and there’s always risk with a player that age regardless of who they are.
I’m not saying this is some huge statement win, but people only say that “doesn’t matter” bullshit when the results go against their favor

If the Nets won, this thread would have had a lot of comments talking about Lakers being in danger of not making the playoffs and all that other nonsense. But we won so now it’s just “regular season doesn’t matter”. Dumb af
It has little impact, but I wouldn’t say it has no impact. It showed how bad their defense is compared to ours and how we could match up fully healthy. And when a heavily injured team beats a superteam of course there’s gonna be a lot of reading into it. It’s not that complicated
As I just said, only 2 of those were impressive wins and I’m saying they got too much credit for it
What information led you to that conclusion?
Atleast you're agreeing with me now lol
When you guys got Dennis and Montrez many people were saying LA's bench could be its own starting five and still be a playoff team. Maybe its just classic LA delusion, I guess.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Nor is it harden’s problem
Lmao okay stop using narratives and storylines. From a basketball standpoint Harden is the mvp
Well I didnt and don't have expectations for him to be great in LA. Maybe he will be great compared to most people's expectations but I think when he realizes oh I have lebron and AD here he will cut back a lot. Bron will destroy that man lol.

But yeah wait and see I'm just saying I don't think he will end up a negative asset since they got him for nothing.
Looks like he just beat the Nets by 20 so he's good
He was a higher USG% when he was on the floor, but also only played 29 mpg. Sexton and Garland were getting more touches overall.
Imagine how Lakers fans felt all season long. We started keeping receipts REALLY early haha. Something I recommend if Lonzo signs with yall, cuz there will be a lot of people still talking shit about the Knicks but he and Randle would be a great duo.
Sure, but they're also making it seem like it was some kind of generic view.  Vegas (which tends to reflect *actual sentiment* better) begs to differ.
Yeah I feel you, but I’d rather it be based off record than just the coach that beat the preseason win prediction by the most, cuz a lot of the time, the teams regress and the awards look dumb in hindsight. This way, atleast the best coaches get some kind of accolades, like pop only has one COY or something lmao.

In an ideal world they’d take all factors into context, but snyder getting a 60 win equivalent with a team with no top 15-20 players on the roster is also a rare and COY worthy achievement
They ended up the #1 seed, but not many predictions had them at #1.

Flair up lil bih
Yea he pulled the second grade comeback card. Risky move, only works if the other person is under the age of 10
oh like when Lakers lost to the Nets? Ok buddy. Did you forget KD sonned Lebron already multiple times? Lmao.

Lol cause I’ve definitely never changed my user name or have multiple accounts. I’ve been a Lakers fan my entire life my guy. Glad you wasted your time combing through my post history though.
They sat Harris at the same time, game was out of reach.

And the last game *was* a sign of trouble, that's why they signed Drummond and McLemore.
[deleted]
I wasn't spouting there was "only 1 ball" when Harden was traded - I was too busy laughing at the Rockets trading him for peanuts. 

Both AD and Schroeder didn't play in the first game...but it was still a good Brooklyn win I guess. 

Since then, Lakers have made many great additions to their team which provide more depth and scoring options. 

Brooklyn have made some additions too...none of which solve their biggest problem - interior defense. 

Brooklyn was never taking over today...even if Irving wasn't rejected. They had no answers on the inside and the Lakers defense played KD perfectly. If they continue to be this bad on the inside AD is going to have a field day in the playoffs...that if Brooklyn even make it out of the east...the 76ers will also destroy them on the inside.

Also KD played just as many minutes as every other starter. He was benched because Brooklyn got blown the fuck out.
Oh my god, you sound so triggered hahaha. Did I expose you? Those capital letters sure make it seem like you got mad.

What theories? They won. They’re stating an absolute fact that the Nets got run by the Lakers without most of their best players. The Nets should have destroyed this team when Kyrie was still in. Plus you can’t really use Kyrie being ejected as an excuse. He got himself ejected lol. Lastly, Durant was still playing and had everyone but Harden this game. Should be an easy win here for the Nets.
Drummond and Schroder might not be, but what about LeBron and AD?
[deleted]
[removed]
You're slipping. Your comments stopped making sense.
Jimmy has some massive respect from me. He’s like a mini LeGM/LeFranchise all his own. Only “low stats” guy I’ve ever seen do this, almost reminds me of Iggy but even more impactful
I think Drummond isn't as good as dwight defensively, but at this stage of his career, he is better offensively. Which does help out. It gives the team one sure fire way to get points. With dwight the team still lack a scoring option down low.
You obviously are a little overzealous in thinking LeBron is gonna be hampered. He's gonna have time to get back into shape. We're also a lot deeper than last year. Don't be surprised if the Lakers handle the nuggets relatively easily if they face the nuggets.
I don't really have a stake in any of this, but when teams are hurt it really doesn't matter in my opinion.  If teams are healthy, sure you can definitely add some weight to a blowout win (ie the Jazz are strong), but this doesn't say much about either team, and definitely nothing to form a conclusion with.
Lakers have superior D for sure and the best in the league but no people shouldn’t take this forward to how they would matchup as both teams would be totally different and we won’t really see it until the finals. Lakers have big question Marks with their health than I feel nets do currently
Winning at blazers was also an impressive win they also beat them without kyrie too from what I can remember
What “many” said that and were actually taken seriously? Lol that’s the real delusion. Absolutely no way this bench is a playoff team in the west
I have dreams that don't come true too. It's ok.
You're so scared you starting deleting your history, AWWW, is the little girl scared I found out you're 23 years old? lmao.
The contract he was under disagrees with you.
Even from a strictly basketball standpoint he’s not lol those “narratives” just make it worse
....you think he's going to get worse playing alongside AD and LBJ?


BWAHAHAHAH
Drummond had more fga than garland
That was only because we had a fuckton of bigs when he was here and almost no viable bench guards.
I don’t think anyone is getting completely wronged by quin winning it, but I’m just saying COTY in a perfect world is how the coach puts together the team with the players he has, which no one has done better than Vogel in that regard imo. Even if you don’t consider Mitch or Rudy top 15-20, (which I absolutely think both of them are at least that) they have a third all star in Conley, ingles, who is probably having one of the best role playing seasons in the league this year, and a great bench. I think quin has done an incredible job with the people he has, but I think Vogel has done better
Oh so you're talking about before the season start? Who cares? No one expected the Jazz being #1 this season either and even though they are now, no one is respecting them currently. That's a bigger disrespect than anything Lakers received. Clippers were predicted ahead of everyone because of course people were going to put the last season finals winner and MVP Kawhi Leonard as the guy to go to the finals.
Sure, Laker fans sure like to act like Victims. Largest fanbase is also the most delusional. Just spam one word comments instead of actual arguments lmao.
Then why didn't he noob? Isn't that exactly what you said? lmao
[deleted]
Lol so is that why she deleted her comment? Lmao

Yeah it was really hard scrolling down for 10 secs and ctrl f'ing lakers.


It's alright, internet points validate your existence. Best of rest of day to ya! Maybe you can revive someone if you get enough of that karma.
Nice so no real answer huh? Guess Lakers shouldn't have Lebron play if they want to beat the Nets next time.
>Brooklyn was never taking over today...even if Irving wasn't rejected. They had no answers on the inside and the Lakers defense played KD perfectly. If they continue to be this bad on the inside AD is going to have a field day in the playoffs...that if Brooklyn even make it out of the east...the 76ers will also destroy them on the inside.

&#x200B;

I mean KD who was on minute restrictions in only his 2nd game, really? Is the bar that low? Despite the so called interior defense of the Lakers we still got this from KD. Are people forgetting KD is the best player in the league when healthy?

https://twitter.com/BrooklynNets/status/1381058967942656001?s=20 

&#x200B;

Also about Brooklyn taking over, the gap was already closing by the 2nd half. It's easy to assume Nets would have overtaken them. Nets have come back multiple time being behind and winning the game. Also this team already beat the 76'ers with Embiid. I'd be more worried for the Lakers making it out of the West. Their shooters are still nowhere near as good as all the other contenders in the West.
[deleted]
KD who was limited minutes and only his 2nd game back? That is a low bar for this win. Kyrie was playing well though. In fact they closed the gap, the Lakers had on the Nets slow start by the 2nd half just as KD was checking back into the game. They were already getting momentum back before the ejection.

Jimmy reminds me of prime Iggy, but with better scoring and facilitating. If his body holds up, I can see Jimmy playing that Iggy 6th man role on a championship team later. Which is impressive because Jimmy's already at (or slightly past?) the age Iggy decided to take on that 6th man role for the Warriors.
You’re obviously a little overzealous if you think any 36 year old athlete is just completely immune to a nagging injury that’s notoriously hard to get over. Don’t be surprised if the Lakers aren’t in rhythm by the playoffs and get upset
One team being significantly more hurt and still pulling off a blowout win is something to give credit to. But whatever, there’s obviously no changing your mind
Did you forget about being the reigning champs tho...? I don't understand this weird underdog complex you have

Again, it’s better for the org to say he’s not happy to trade him. If he were to say he’s happy and leave in free agency, Houston lose him for nothing. You have this massive harden hate boner too big that blocks you from seeing reality. 

As a Houston fan/manager, would you rather he pout whilst under contract so you trade him for pieces, or would you rather have him do what Lebron and KD did - lose him for nothing in return?

Hell, since you’re a Knicks fan, would you rather RJ or Randal say nothing and play under contract, then abruptly leave in free agency. Or have them display their dislike towards the team/org so you get to trade them for pieces.

The latter happened to the pelicans and they got Ingram & zo. The former happened to the cavs & thunder and they got NOTHING
Keep hating
That's not what I meant. I was saying that when AD and Bron are back I think he will cut back on his role
[deleted]
[deleted]
Lol so is that why you deleted your comment cause you cant stand behind the bs you spill? lmao
I didn't play. You sure act like you did. Dude you're probably living in your mom's basement haha.

KD makes Lebron eat his dust.
So let me summarize this interaction:
-You talk some shit (which is fine, talk your shit)
-I talk some shit back
-You get butthurt and delete your original comment because you’re getting downvoted for saying some stupid shit
-You then go into my post history to really stick it to me and expose me as a bandwagon Laker fan
-I say your assumptions are wrong
-You then make some inane comment about me caring about karma which makes no sense in the context of this conversation.

You’re honestly just kinda lame man.
Yeah the Lakers shooters are nowhere near as good as the other contenders in the west....exactly like last year when they got out of the west and won the championship.

Oh, they also have the best defense in the league....while the Nets are bottom 5. 

I'm not even a Lakers fan, so I don't even care either way. 

Not sure why you posted the KD dunk...it was nice and all but adds literally nothing to what we're talking about. The minutes restriction is also irrelevant because he played as much as every other starter.

I laughed at your depiction of an alternate reality where Brooklyn made a comeback today - news flash from the real world - *they didn't and they lost.* 

76ers with Embiid also beat Brooklyn and from memory Embiid feasted with 30+ points. 

At the end of the day Nets were a  -11 favourite today and  got their asses handed to them. 

/end.
Yup sounds like you mad. Had to bring out the emoji huh? It helps hide the anger.
It’s a low bar because you have two superstar players playing in this game. Regardless of the ejection it’s an easy win. You have Irving, Durant, Harris, Aldridge, and Griffin. You’re telling me that those guys aren’t able to put away a team that has Schroeder and Drummond as the best players for the night?
The Nets were winning at some point in the late 2nd qrt, the 1st half ended with a 3 point difference for the Lakers and the ejection happened with the Lakers up 4. I don't know what reality you live in or what game you were watching to have seen the Nets with momentum. Not to mention Schroder was being the man of the match until that point but let's ignore that and his ejection. You are a clown. Take the L and leave.
[deleted]
[removed]
your spelling is atrocious. Get help little girl.
You sound nervous lol.
One team was not significantly more hurt, I think the nets are missing as much as the lakers (particularly in the second half, first half sure but that was much closer) with kyrie and KD out the second half.  Maybe the only conclusion I would come to is bench strength off of this game, although dont forget they are still missing Dinwiddie.  

Basically, I see Lebron, AD, Schroeder, Gasol, Kuzma and Matthews being out as less than or equal to a loss of KD, Kyrie, Harden, and Dinwiddie.

Lmk if I'm missing anyone, but here's where Im coming from
Where the fuck am I giving an underdog complex? Lol because I said our bench wouldn’t be in the playoffs? That’s an objective fact. And we shouldn’t have won this game with all the injuries which is another fact. Of course I still think we’re the best team but that’s when we’re healthy.
yeah your mickey mouse ring. Too bad I'm talking about dreams for this year lmao.
I didn't lose, cause I didn't delete my history like a pussy lmao.
You’re a wolves fan anyway lol follow your weak team
Look everyone, a Lakers fan acting like a victim lmao.
Yeah you're in middle school child. I guess you weren't alive for the past decade when they were losing.
[deleted]
You mean when the competition was nowhere near as good as they are now? Clippers, Suns, Jazz, and Nuggets especially recently have improved by a considerable amount this season. The only competition last year for the Lakers was the Clippers who choked in the bubble and then Lakers played a #5 seed who thrived in the bubble and then were missing 2 of their top 3 best players in the finals. It's called a Mickey mouse ring for a reason.

&#x200B;

The defense is actually a lot more improved than stats indicate, but if you want to go by that, Nets also have the best offense in NBA history.

&#x200B;

>Not sure why you posted the KD dunk...it was nice and all but adds literally nothing to what we're talking about. The minutes restriction is also irrelevant because he played as much as every other starter.

&#x200B;

He may have played but not consistently considering he was going back and forth to the bench on only his 2nd game back. Otherwise, are people going to keep the same energy when AD or Lebron aren't in full form in the first few games they come back?

&#x200B;

>76ers with Embiid also beat Brooklyn and from memory Embiid feasted with 30+ points.  
>  
>At the end of the day Nets were a -11 favourite today and got their asses handed to them.

The game that only had James Harden against the entire 76'ers team? You know Kyrie and KD were out right?
[deleted]
Your mistake is assuming LMA and Blake is anywhere near good as those other guys. Irving was the primary playmaker tonight so I'll say the team probably fell apart once he left. KD isn't even playing 100% so even he was limited to what he could do when he kept going back and forth to bench all game. Nets best primary playmaker is Harden and that dude is durable so he'll help the team when the time comes.
[removed]
[deleted]
No? Idc either way really, it’s to early to know. But idk why you’re so confident when neither guy is even playing yet
KD wasn’t out. And Kyrie got thrown out on his own but still played the first half. That’s not equal but I guess I understand your argument, just disagree
[deleted]
[deleted]
Lol weak argument
[deleted]
Yeah it's the Slim Reaper. Lebron will never be MJ let alone Kobe or KD. LMAO
You know Kyrie and KD also can't contain Embiid in the post right? 

Also, my original point was that the likelihood of Durant, Harden and Irving all being healthy and available across the playoffs is fairly low given recent history. 

The Lakers, 76ers, Bucks, Clippers all have great offenses and much better defense than Brooklyn. 

In fact, the Nuggets and Jazz currently have the same offensive rating as the Nets. The Clippers are even better.  

The Nets only have the best offensive team on paper - they haven't proven shit yet - because nobody can stay healthy long enough to string a consistent lineup together. 

I still don't know exactly what you're arguing about - are you trying to say the loss from the Nets today was expected despite being -11 favourites and pretty much everyone predicting a blow-out? Lol.

Also, it's only called a Mickey Mouse ring because Lebron won - nobody would be saying shit if it was another team.
It's ok, I know you already lost once you deleted your comment. Can't back your shit huh lmao.
Just look at the pelicans game as an example. Griffin went 4-6 and Aldridge went 8-12. They both combined for 32 points. You’re telling me they can’t average a combined 30 between those two a game? That’s just silly man. They’re still good and aren’t nearly as covered as Durant or Irving. Also, even with Durant having a minutes restriction, he could put up 30 easily on the team the Lakers had out there tonight. The Lakers also lost their primary playmaker in Schroeder and still pulled out a win. So I really don’t think the win is lessened because Irving was ejected. You’re just excusing the loss due to that. Take responsibility and say Irving fucked up and you should have still won without him since after Schroeder was kicked, the best player on the Lakers was Drummond and the best player on the nets was Kevin Durant lol that’s not comparable at all. That’s like me trying to defend the magic losing against a college team. The Lakers were missing LeBron, AD, Kuzma, Gasol, and had half a game of Schroder, and still won against the Nets that only missed Harden for the game. Nets are going to have a rough time in the playoffs tbh. I think the Sixers will actually knock them out if they’re not able to play hard defense. That’s their biggest issue. They let the Lakers garbage time team blow them out and were just missing Harden, who’s not known for his defense. Although he is better at it than he used to be it doesn’t change much tbh. Nets need a defensive anchor and they don’t have one.
His point was why do you need all of that to beat essentially a team of G leaguers, especially when two of your superstars played for about half the game?
[removed]
Because LeBron has proven time and time again that he's the best player in the world. It's easy to be confident when he's on your side.
KD was on a minutes restriction and still isn't back to full, and I counted both Schroeder and Kyrie as missing.
No shit, no one knows. One thing I do know for sure. It won't be the Lakers lmao.
Nah, it's cause you don't by the shit you spew. Sorry, you're a pussy.
>Nah we lose so we can win later

I guess this is how you cope?
Lebron doesn't even need to beat KD, KD is made of glass and will injure himself out again 😂
> I still don't know exactly what you're arguing about - are you trying to say the loss from the Nets today was expected despite being -11 favourites and pretty much everyone predicting a blow-out? Lol. 

Being favorites before a game doesn't take into account what happens during the game. No one predicted Kyrie getting his very first career ejection and making us lose out playmaker for example. But, either way not the first Nets lost. Onwards to the next game.

&#x200B;

> You know Kyrie and KD also can't contain Embiid in the post right? 

They won't need to when they can shoot from pretty much anywhere. It's not like they haven't beaten this team before. 

&#x200B;

> Also, my original point was that the likelihood of Durant, Harden and Irving all being healthy and available across the playoffs is fairly low given recent history. 

This is just starting to sound like wishful thinking more than anything. This entire season has players getting injured left and right. It happens. Nets are doing the same thing as any other team would. Rest and rehab and hopefully come back healthy for the playoffs like any team would. Cause other wise we could say the same for Anthony Davis who is also injury prone and got tendonitis issues that could flare back up and become an achilles tear. No one knows.
Sure Blake and LMA could get hot but you shouldn't depend on them for consistent scoring like the other guys and maybe Joe Harris. People were calling them washed and now you're assuming they should be able to play on the level on the big 3. But I will accept that yes, Nets fucked up tonight. It happens. It was a bad game. But your hot takes are also ridiculous to have based on this one game. They are literally at the top of the seedings in the East and tied 1 and 1 with the 76'ers and the time they lost to the 76'ers only had James Harden playing. 

Did you also forget Nets literally carved through the West when they went on their roadtrip? When they have atleast 2 of their top 3 best players playing on the court fully(because they have that luxury), it's very hard to see them losing.
Wait how are you calling them G leaguers though? Most of them are starters and still have the #1 defense in the league do they not?
[deleted]
Yeah, felt the same way with Peyton Manning them he got a high ankle sprain and was never the same again. You just don’t know

Kind of ironic considering Lebron is currently sitting out on an injury....
It's not really wishful thinking - the Nets roster is full of injury prone players from top to bottom - more so than any competitor in the league.

Your whole reply pretty much exemplified the lack of depth in Brooklyn. Lost a playmaker and whole Nets team imploded today. Conversely, the Lakers lost theirs and they proceeded to dad dick Brooklyn off the court. 

Outside of Brooklyn, the east is more offensively stacked than it has been in years. Defense is going to be the difference in the playoffs and Brooklyn doesn't have any.
Lol what i meant was just a bunch of role players. The point still stands, why do you need so much to beat so little?
[removed]
yawwnnnn, you're getting boring. Try better.

Boohoo. KD will get injured again, mark my words.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYrA30qcvK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYrA30qcvK4)
Once again, just a bunch of what if scenarios about them having injuries in the playoffs that may or may not happen. It can happen to anyone else as well but you're really trying your hardest to act like they are made of glass lmao. 

&#x200B;

>Your whole reply pretty much exemplified the lack of depth in Brooklyn. Lost a playmaker and whole Nets team imploded today. Conversely, the Lakers lost theirs and they proceeded to dad dick Brooklyn off the court. 

See I wouldn't even say that because even when they had playmakers on the court, they still lost to teams like Cavs, Pistons, and Wizards. It's because this season they have been playing up and down to their competition. They don't play as hard when the team they are going against isn't a contender. That's why a lot of their games always end up being won by a few points like against the Timberwolves or Orlando Magic. But then they play really well against contenders like all the teams in the West, 76er's and Bucks and winning against them mind you. Perhaps knowing Lakers best players were out didn't have them play as seriously. All they will need to do is ramp their game up for every playoff game and they have a good chance of winning with their offensive power and playmaking by Harden.
Shit happens. The Cavs beat them as well. Where are the narratives for their team? Anyone who followed the games has noticed Nets have played up or down to the level of their competition. They will play really well against teams that are contenders at full strength and be in a close game against lesser teams like Timberwolves and Orlando Magic. Perhaps seeing the Lakers starters tonight made them once again not play as hard they could have.

And AD will get the same thing with his tendonitis. Reap what you sow lmao.
Championship teams don't play down to their opponents. You reaching now.

Also KD himself: 

https://twitter.com/Alex__Schiffer/status/1381084493482721282?s=20
And is that somehow a good thing to willingly not try? And according to Power Rankings Guru, the Nets have statistically had the absolute easiest schedule in the NBA thus far.
Why should I? Your comments aren't worth replying back to in a timely manner.
already.

The word is already. I know 1st graders with better spelling than you.
[removed]
idc about AD, Lebron will carry the lakers to the finals again while harden will choke like he usually does and KD will get injured
1. They aren't a championship team yet
2. It literally takes a second to look at their past games to see exactly what I'm talking about. lmao. Perhaps if you actually watch the game, you would know this. This same Nets team that lost to the Wizards, Hawks, Thunder, Grizzlies were winning against teams like the Nuggets, Jazz, Clippers, and 76'ers. Look at their most recent games and you'll see they win against most of the lesser teams by only a few points.
No of course not, just giving context. People are continuously calling them a superteam expecting them to have a perfect season so when they lose, all the hot takes come out. As for the power rankings, the site is down so I can't confirm. But, Nets at the beginning of the season were actually racking up a bunch of losses against lesser teams and winning against all the good teams. Take from that what you will. They also went on their west coast trip and beat all the contending teams as well which is no easy feat. It's not like they were #1 from the beginning, their ranking went from 5 or 6 I believe and were able to go up to 1 or 2.

Nah, you can't act like you won when you don't even stand by your comments. Pussies never win. Try to believe in the things you say. I have to bring your age and gender because it helps me explain why you're so obsessed with me.
Lol the same Lebron who couldn't win against the Nets last time when he didn't have AD? hahaha. Sorry this isn't the easy East anymore like it was the past decade. He's on the West and every other team is playing so much better than the Lakers with actual shooters. Jazz, Clippers with Rondo, Nuggets, and Suns.
I've watched almost every Brooklyn game this season (most people probably have). I see a team with no interior defense.

Then I look at every contender in the league and they are all killers on the inside, have just as good offensive ratings and are not top heavy like the Nets. Pretty much all of them have more stability in their rotations too and aren't relying on Dinwiddie coming back from a torn ACL to improve their depth. 

I know it's exciting to have a team that's finally relevant, but no matter what way you swing it, there was a lot to be concerned about during tonight's performance. 

We just going around in circles now. Hope you find some pepper for that salt you throwing around.
I will admit, their West coast tear was pretty crazy. Nothing I can take from them there.
Nah
Nah I don't want people typing like a Neanderthal.

Sure Zoey.
how much easier the season wouldve been with a competent center from the beginning 

even a backup like birch
4 straight wins lol we suck at tanking
This is the worst tank of all time
Fine us you cowards
THAT GUY ROBBED THE KID OF KYRIES JERSEY WTF
[Remember when the Nets were up by 13 points and had the lead at halftime](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/l9smus/z/gnc5h9x)
so who we playing in the first round?
Birch crushed it
Anyone else see that dick in the nets jersey steal the jersey that kyrie threw to the kids after the game
Damn...Raptors are 2-0 on the Nets this season. Talk about a serious division rivalry.
Man, did anyone else see that grown ass man steal Kyrie's jersey from that kid? Feels bad, man.
#I WANT YOUR PASCAL RECEIPTS
bruh if we had birch from the beginning of the season instead of baynes we probably make the playoffs
GTJ definitely needs to understand how to pick his shots better. He’s taking shots like he’s Paul George or something
TO TANK OR NOT TO TANK? I DONT KNOW ANYMORE
The Nets didn't reach the 40 wins plateau before 20 losses. Oh no what does this do to their championship aspirations?
I don't think the Raptors were ever actually tanking and that was actually just a way for Raptors fans to rationalize their team underperforming due to myriad reasons (covid, tampa, not having a center, injuries, bad luck etc)
are you guys tanking or not lmao
tank fans in shambles right now
Thank you raptors very cool 😁
#NOW WATCH US SWEEP THEM IN THE PLAYOFFS

Thank raptors
Boucher died for this
Lets goo raptors
Fuck tanking
If we only have to play 1/3rd of Brooklyn, we could win a championship
Someone link that Siakam plays bad against good teams stat
That kid in the end having a field day with Kyrie's sweaty jersey lmao
Are raptor fans trolling or do they seriously believe they are tanking lol. Why would you not want to make the playoffs
Does Siakam yell every time he goes to the basket or was it just this game ?
https://youtu.be/-cmwmTNeWxs
Oh
comin for dat play in ass
WE ARE NOT TANKING
1.	Death
2.	Taxes
3.	Nets 0.5 game behind the Sixers for the 1st seed
That 40 before 20 thing isn't real right?
We are a decent team when we have more than one competent center on the roster.

Who knew
The Raptors with actual Centres are not a trash team!

What a massive difference a full roster makes.
Pascal just spun his way into the MVP race
Fuck tank is over. Hope we get Keon
this team makes no fucking sense
Bench tlc.
4 game tank win streak!
Inject this win streak into my veins
Nets going into the playoffs hobbled against one of the most physical defensive teams in the league 1st round.
Idk what I want anymore. Let's go for the 9 seed and live with it
Raptor fan coming in peace just to say "Fuck Brooklyn"
all i want is for harden and durant to be back and healthy
Amazing what competent centers do
We won, but at what cost. 

Boucher left the game with a knee injury... knee injuries are no bueno
So the Raps just told us all to FO lol. They played hard and well tonight.
Chris Boucher died for this.
but at what cost :(
I think the Raptors got their “tank” button switched with our “win now” button, wtf
Play Ron Baynes...
We need the tank commander Baynes to come back, w can't be winning these games this late in the season.
Can’t wait to either get the 14th pick or get swept in the first round. We’re the new Orlando Magic.
Why did Gary Trent only play 14 mins ?
Second night in the road for B2B, no Claxton and backup PG.
Nets looks like running on fumes.

Eh could be worse. At least no additional injuries.

4-4 in the last 8, injuries problem are catching up.
Nets has just failed Phil Jackson's contender criteria
4
Raps fans acting like they beat us at even 75% health
Sixers got fucked and helped by fate in the span of an hour haha
you have been banned from the aaron baynes fan club.
there's no denying that we playoff team 

but I'm kinda confused with whats happening last few games .. are tanking or not
Honestly did not expect Arom Baynes to be hot garbage. I know the Raptors had the season from hell but Baynes has honestly not looked NBA-worthy. He's deserved 0 minutes and a stint in the GLeague at best.
tank cancelled
We just beat the Nets. Fuck a tank, whats wrong with some of you.
like WTF are we doing?
\#WeTheBelieve Raptors?
Task failed successfully.
Fuck the tank gimme all the wins baby
This is a vintage Raptors season. Be one of the worst team in the conference only to go on a win streak near the end to end up with the 9th pick. Except this season we have a play-in tournament so we actually have a shot at the playoffs. Imagine this tournament 10 years ago? We would be pumped at the prospect of finishing 10th and possibly making the playoffs. 

I don't know, I guess it's cool perspective of how this far this franchise has come. Playoffs don't mean that much anymore whereas before we were starved to make the playoffs. Either way, I can't deny, watching them in a play-in tournament would be fun, even if I'd rather have the pick long-term.
Tank put on hold for this game. We back next game
Again!
orlando magic with the most tactical tank of all - give good players to tanking teams, sit back, and watch our lottery odds rise
Yeah that pissed me off
Tampa Bay is just the worst
Clip?

Bruh when this started the Nets were starting Jarrett Jack, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez



They played the Spurs, who started Tony Parker, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Tim Duncan and LaMarcus Aldridge

Ah, the classic 😂

Yeah I got sidetracked at half time came back and Nets were trailing?! O__o
I’m sad you’re back but so glad
If I'm counting right this is the 58th iteration, are you going to do anything special for #69 or 100?
If the Net's end up choking and get eliminated in this way in either the first round or the finals of the upcoming playoffs, your comment might become the most upvoted/gilded in this sub's history
Brooklyn 😈
I hope it’s Philly, and I want to see Philly up 3-1
I only have one thing to say:

#FUCK BROOKLYN
I felt so bad for that kid, man.
lol that was ruthless.. I hope he gave it back
That kid looked like he got boxed out by a grown ass woman, and then Nets jersey jumped the gap for the big steal.
It's a great rivalry...

Raptors are 24-2 against the Nets in their last 26 games.
That grown ass man was a zoomer baby with a fortnite shirt under his jersey brother wym
I hate Florida
YOu can look at mine. Got nothing to hide, I swear.
Peep mine, nothing but love here
We might make the playoffs now with the play in, whit birch we could be a four seed
We still might with the way we've been playing!
We're pretty likely to make the playoffs this year anyways... With Birch we're like a 4 seed.
Now you understand why the Blazers traded him for Norm. He'll get better with more experience and discipline.
GTJ is who Raptors fans think FVV is (non-passing chucker)
I know nothing about you, but if you grew up watching early years Raps, you'd HATE the idea of tanking...
Sooooooo much trash ass basketball.

I'm not ready for those days again, this year notwithstanding...
Fuck. Blow it up. Trade the big 3 and build around TLC
I guess the Nets and the Lakers not making the Finals smh
Oh trust me, we are aware of those reason too. We will grab onto all of it if it means we dont have to admit our team is just playing bad.
I think the biggest reason was the move to Tampa. I can only imagine its like working out at the same gym for as long as you can remember and going home and sleeping in your own bed to working out at a new gym that was completely different and then sleeping in your car. You're never gonna perform like you should when you're taken away from your comfort zone.

Combine that with a center who can't shoot, defend, rebound or move fast and you'll convince the whole league you're tanking.
Bingo.
We didn't start out tanking but for a lot of people it became the best course. This core is locked in for the future with basically no meaningful way to improve it and I'd rather have a %30 chance at a top 4 pick than get stomped in the first round.
Well, we did get fined for it, but when we won a few games with none of our usual starters playing, maybe the Org changed their tune.
The question that has been causing a civil war on the raptors sub for the entire season.
We dont know
If we were truly tanking, Baynes would be starting every game.
The front office is tanking.

The players, not so much.
Damned if we know. We're doing it all wrong but the team is actually really freaking good when you have 2 competent centers and a bench that knows what they're about. 

We should still tank this year to get that lotto pick and then ruin the league next season. Our guys are just too good right now though.
The raps will realistically only fall below Chicago and Sacramento even if they actively tank. They are within 1.5 games of each other, and neither of those teams are tanking so it dropping 1.5 games over the final 13 should be easy. They don’t have to lose every game. It’s a controlled tank.
Raptors tanking....their way to championship #2
Yall next
Bubble remix
I'll allow it
I would love it to be the Raptors, but either way I really believe the fate of this Nets team is a first round exit.
What happened with Boucher? I only started watching in the middle of the fourth.
Brooklyn and losing to the Raptors
Siakam and hooking up a super bowl team with his jerseys.
Siakam and beating kds teams when he’s not playing.
KD didn’t play?
KD keeps ducking us!
I like the way you think
When is poor Kyrie gonna get some help this is sad \#FreeKyrie
We beat 2/3rds earlier this year tho
This wouldn’t support your argument. We’re down 6 players and a bad defensive team
Wasn’t that last season?
Look at the rest schedule our starters had for the last two weeks, plus the amount of games some players missed for penny-ante injuries. Normally something like "right leg soreness" will leave you out for a game or two (or get a real diagnosis), not like 6.

If the front office wasn't tanking, they sure weren't trying very hard to win.

As for the fans, some NBA fans are all about championship or nothing. If the team isn't going to win a championship that year, they want them to get as low in the standings as possible to get a high pick, so that they can win a championship sooner.

Me, I like watching my team do well. I'd rather see the Raptors make the playoffs for 10 years before eking out a ring, then see them tank for five to win it.
Because we would get swept.
Most of the time, yeah.

It's like his version of the Serena Williams Grunt, except mixed with the Bruce Lee turkey gobble.
He learned it from Demar.

Raptors have a tradition of not getting a lot of free throws.
It’s not every time he goes to the basket, but it’s a pretty frequent occurrence during games.
Pretty much anytime there is a slight bit of contact
He is very vocal when going to the basket all the time
Ibaka taught him that.
Yes
West coast trip coming up, it ain't over yet
Fuck Tank? I thought they closed that place down!?!
you love to see it
I don't mind sacrificing the tank for the greater good of the league
Raps round one followed by Knicks round two would be exhausting.
Because there were better guards ahead of him available to play.
Shooting left handed fading away at half court, is not a high % shot
He’s a stud but he’s not getting minutes from FVV and Lowry
Norm only started once we gave up on having a centre. Starting lineup should've always been Lowry, Fred, OG, Siakam, +centre.
He was bad tonight, starters did better
Good point about tonight, but you were above 75% when we played you earlier this season and won.
Pretty sure you were as close to healthy as you've been all season when they beat you the first time, you sound so salty, lol.
Who without new content is posting old Suns and Celtics highlights.
At this rate Aron Baynes is banned from the Aron Baynes fan club
That guy is actively losing it on twitter this past week lol. I understand this fanbase can be pretty mean and he got a lot of shit to deal with but like he's also pretty cringey and Aron Baynes is in contention for worst raptor all time. Honestly he's been that bad.
It's the management that tanks, not the players. They are there to win. If the coaching teams puts out a starter 5 that includes OG, Siakam, Lowry, and VanVleet, that team will win.
I think "developing" is a better term. Nurse is against tanking, and I'm not sure about the FO but lots of FOs don't believe tanking works (and remember that FOs see results in dollars, not in rings).
The raps have trust in their scouting and drafting, so tanking doesn’t seem to be a priority for them.
Easy schedule and Nets without Harden/KD.

If they're still doing this against the west coast trip and Memphis/Washington then I'll be on board
He's definitely lost a step but he was a defensive center to begin with. That doesn't really help the raptors.
Has cancel culture gone too far?
Plz no
Second time we've beat them this season. We also beat milwaukee twice and the 76ers once
No Harden or KD, still a W and fuck Brooklyn but small asterisk there.
I didn't say I'm against winning I wanna be in the playoffs fam
yea that win sure means a lot in the grand scheme of things
A hardenless + Durantless nets on a B2B.
No harden or KD
SUBSCRIBE
I hope the Raptors and the Wizards are the teams that make the play in game. I could definitely see either of those teams make some shit happen in the playoffs (though I'd prefer they didn't knock out the Heat)
We’ve won 4 straight
When in Florida...
Living life on the edge!
So they can beat us 4-1?

Is there raptor net beef? Or is it just cause the nets are a good team now. Were people yelling Fuck Indiana in 2000? They probably were huh. Reggie was annoying. Anyways, thanks for the chat.

Seriously though...it feels like the Raptors don’t want the nets to be the last team in the Division to win an easy championship.
y'all need a big man after LMA retired.  how about one very lightly used Aron Baynes?  we'll take back Harden.  sounds like a great deal to me!
They don't want no scrubs
It's funny how heated these debates get, when at the end of the day, we are all fans who have zero influence on those decisions and all we can do is cheer on the team.
That's why they acquired a player after the trade deadline that literally fixes our lineup and didnt trade our best player...
Obviously, there’s no way it happens because talent, but would that be one of the greatest NBA stories of all time or what?
Knee Sprain, nets player landed on his ankle and it looked like a bad tweak.
Paul Pierce would like a word
Pascal shows up. KD doesnt. That should tell you everything.
Not his fault KD can’t stay healthy
I believe that's the joke given KD also didn't play in the finals in 2019.
Poor guy keeps leaving teams cuz he doesn't want to be a part of a rebuild and just ends up in the same spot.
was that the game that KD played like 8min and got shutdown over health protocols? hahhahah man I was fuming over that shit
Yeah, but we're the 2021 Raptors
I'm just making fun of the anti-Siakam posts
I still have hope. But the contenders might rest their players
My god that sounds like a nightmare for a mostly offense-based team.
im not talking about then tho
just saying yall acting like u won the chip again or something damn
I've got Raphael Aroujo and Aron Baynes neck and neck at this point.
Disrespect to Bargnani
If the FO wants to tank they don't sign Birch, which fixes our team.
Yeah I'm sure everyone's holding their breath waiting for you to get on board. Just let us have this W man
Beat 'em with Harden too ;).
If he were able to defend like before that alone would help significantly. I really think his drop off may have been at least in part because he caught covid. It definitely would have helped the raps
Back to back also for Nets, and Raptors been resting. But a W is a W :D
Raps win plenty without kawhi in the lineup
Yeah but the Raps have stunk so any win is great right now. 

We’ve also lost to Colin sexton so I think a win over Kyrie is nice.
Tank is just refueling
Nah it's from way back lol. But this line is from this legendary Masai video:

https://youtu.be/-cmwmTNeWxs
Masai said “Fuck Brooklyn” to a crowd before our 2014 first round playoff series, and it kinda stuck. 

So far as I know it’s little more than a meme within the fan base at this point, rather than genuine hatred of the Nets.

Edit: 2013 -> 2014
Nah it’s honestly just a meme from like 2014. I can’t really recall any reason for Raptors fans to dislike the nets (except for everything Paul Pierce)
If we have beef with any team it’s the Nets. Obviously we’ve been division rivals for ages. However it got heated when Carter was traded there. Peaked in 07 with that  playoff series (I was super young back then but I remember watching it with the family). 

The whole thing went on the back burner after Vince left, but then 2014 playoffs rolled around, and things were back on. Given that series was the beginning of the We the North era it means ALOT. Start of our journey to the championship.

I don’t think there’s any hatred between the fanbases, most of the beef is just due to us older fans remember the Carter debacle. But that plus their playoff defeat of us in 2014 being a very iconic moment for us  this decade, just ultimately means that our two teams have some good history.
nah its just a reference to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmwmTNeWxs
We bounced them with Pierce & KG that one time, I don't think there's any good will between the two franchises.

Also, the Vince Carter debacle
How does it feel to have your superteam implode before the playoffs?
Dont care, still got a chip. Now cry harder
How does it feel to currently be the 2nd best team in NY? YERRRRRRRRRRRRRR
[Say what now?](https://streamable.com/o0pbnb)
It's gonna be funny when the Nets get bounced in the second round, blow the fuck up in 2 seasons, and then go through another decade of no-one-cares. Clips of the East.
Idk man that looks like the “Nah fuck you I’m taking this” look
The Garden sends there regards.
Harden with Pascal, OG and Lowry would absolutely slap
They acquired a back-up centre who unexpectedly blossomed into a low-tier starter.

Khem Birch was on waivers. The front office couldn't really put a pin in him and wait to get him until the off season. If they hadn't picked him up, someone else would've, and there was no guarantee that they'd be able to find another cost effective backup. They figured they were acquiring a supporting piece, and they'd get the starting centre in the off season.

If the front office was trying to be competitive, they would have traded Norm for a big man, not a younger version of himself. Getting GTJ was 100% a move designed to lose now, win later.

And as for Lowry, they tried to trade him. For reasons of not provoking consumer anger, they didn't want to ship him off against his will, but none of the teams Lowry was willing to go to could put together a trade Masai thought was worth it.
It'd be the 2019 Blues equivalent for the NBA, just a whiplash turnaround

_Near shut out at home in a game 7 flashback intensifies_
ok? you guys are fighting for the 10 seed right now. him showing up hasnt mattered much for you guys this year.
maybe he'll get his shot this year in the playoffs.
Y’all were 5 pt favorites
Eh, all the west coast teams have seeding to play for. Resting on the level of the Raptors isn't going to come into play until the last week or so
Araujo was far worse IMO. But Anthony Bennett did also play for Toronto for a bit.
yeah at least Baynes wasn't the 1st pick
Yeah I don't think our FO ever wanted to tank either. I'm just saying Nurse has publicly said he's against tanking, whereas I'm not sure if the FO has ever addressed it.
Yeah I agree but why the fuck did they ride Baynes all season and have us playing without a centre position until the 11th hour? Was there really nothing available? We knew Baynes was a bust ages ago.
Him being skeptical and thinking differently than you doesn't remotely affect you.
Strangely they haven't started Kawhi in over a year
SEND IN THE BAYNES!
lol oh damn. I think I missed this video. How funny.
holy shit that was 2013? It feels like 2 years ago
I had never even thought about the vince carter angle, but i could totally see that being a thing for a bit after the trade.
We may not have beef with the Bucks, but they do with us.
and the 07 playoff win
Harden will be back around the time of the playoffs. Kd is day to day. Meanwhile the Raptors are going to be sitting on the couch with a bad draft pick, expiring contracts and minimal cap space. Also no one wants to play for Toronto. The literal defintion of being directionless. But hey atleast you have the human beyblade in Siakam! Maybe the Raptors can build a 36 win team around him!
Those jokes hurt more in 2018
Except we have 3 superstars and depht unlike the clippers. And who will they lose to? The Sixers? The Bucks? Lmao 😂
Thiccest backcourt in the league.
But they knew that literally any barely functional centre would be a huge improvement on Aaron Baynes
Nah. KD is just scared of Siakam. Real reason he doesn’t show up is because of a traumatic beyblade incident
Lol imagine having a super team and being this salty
Jesus.... he’s clearly joking.
Dont worry bout the other games. KD dont show up.
So were using gambling lines as stats?
Yeah, I've always been on team "tanking is stupid," and I think all the FO's moves show they're on that also are on that train.  I think fans kinda ran away with the meme!
You don't rest Kyle for multiple games for a minor toe injury if you're actively trying to make playoffs, either.

Basically the Raptors are in a "whatever happens, happens" sort of mode right now. They're not going to take any chances with injuries - I would expect them to rest Boucher for the next couple games - because the risk isn't worth it. They're not going to play anybody extended minutes because there's no point. But if they make playoffs this way, they don't mind.
Probs Masai being patient, trying not to lose on trades etc
The tank commander
It's tradition now with no real malice.  

Just fun to say because it rolls right off the tongue.
dawg, the championship was almost 2 years ago
Pretty sure it was 2014
Oh believe me it is still a thing. My uncles still go on about it to this day. For the 4 ish years Carter was on the Nets the hatred was ALIVE. More for Carter than the Nets specifically (we would have had the same hatred to whatever team Carter went to). Part of it was seeing him return to what seemed like prime Air Canada the minute he got traded. Part of it was the playoff series as well, which was when Bosh was really on the rise. And we wanted to flex our new star beating our old star player. 

Lot of history there, good times honestly. I was a kid for that 07 playoffs, but lowkey that era is the most nostalgic part of Raptors history for me.
85% of r/nba wasn't even alive
You really gonna waste all this energy huh? This is the problem with poverty franchises.
Reminds me of Clippers fans and having to live in the shadow of the Lakers.

Nets fans are the Clippers fans of the East.
having a super team means i cant talk smack when people are talking trash? youre more sensitive than KD
Can’t take a joke tho
What else do you want to use lol?
Uh, yes? Do you have another suggestion?
Tanking in the Raptors particular case this year is stupid, they are almost certainly going to pick 10-15 no matter what they do the rest of the season, they'll get far more value developing a winning mentality in the young players and integrating guys like Watanabe and Birch.
And that parade took 2 years off my life, lol...
Vince always turnt the fuck up when he played the Raptors too. His best games of his career were when he returned to Toronto in a Nets jersey.
Poverty franchise huh? How about the fact that your best player in franchise history only played for 1 year and the mid 2010 are probably most remembered for Lebron bitching them every year? Enjoy irrelevance for the next 5 years.
On a burner or his real account?
Our friggen emotions. We have downright the most disadvantaged team in the NBA this year. Don't look now but I smell a comeback brewing..
Huh? They are literally 9th right now, and only a half game up on the Wizards and the Kings for 7th worst. They have a very, *very* real shot at a top 4 draft pick in the lottery, and I'm honestly starting to get concerned that we are going to piss that away for a comparatively meaningless play in game
Worth it.
I mean I would say the rockets are worse off this year than the raptors.
Fuck yeah it was
Nets bench vastly outplayed our bench in that 4th quarter. 

Bench really really played sloppy. Not having Howard active and playing Mike Scott at center is such an absolute disaster.
I blame the 4th quarter on Mike Scott
The Sixers *need* to get better about helping out Embiid when he gets doubled.  All of their players did a terrible job of helping him out and frankly he's not great at passing out of it himself.

That sort of stuff won't happen in the regular season to the same extent that it happens in the playoffs.
If it wasn’t for the bench getting us back in the game in the 4th, we would probably be getting clowned in this thread.. I love it lol
Why would you not put Kyrie in the game for the final 1:16 after cutting the deficit down to 3?
I’m sure the 76ers didnt have much game plan to stop the 3rd string.  As Danny Green suggested you hold back players to make it harder to game plan for them going fwd.  Same applies.  Who has plans or notes on Alize Johnson.
Me when Simmons misses a free throw with under 2 minutes to go: oh dear, oh dear. Gorgeous

Me when Korkmanz misses a free throw with under 2 minutes to go: You fucking donkey
respect to the nets bench for the comeback. team is obviously well ran
[Nets fans right now](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/490/511/148.jpg)
That was closer than it should have been tbh
Let the record show 

Nets with Kyrie -13 

Nets without Kyrie +8

Facts are the facts. 37 pts is just a social construct
the ref who missed the Shamet push off on Simmons should be suspended
Kyrie has been absolutely amazing this year. Easily his best individual season. Really fun to watch.
That was the prolly the best loss we had all year. I'm so proud of the boys. GG Philly
No real takeaways from this game. Sixers went up 22, a bunch of nets players that won't see playoff minutes made a run on a bunch of sixers that also won't see playoff minutes.
Considering the amount of players we were missing, I’m not terribly upset with the outcome. Still have enough time to get the 1 seed
JV squad almost completely blew it. My goodness. Starters were completely checked out (mentally and physically) when they came back in; I don’t blame them for being out of it when they came back in.
nets fans unironically celebrating moral victories
This Joel Embiid is pretty good at basketball
Lol people are gonna forget they were up and took their foot off the gas and the 76ers played awful. I’m glad we’re back to underdogs though, I never feel good about being people’s favorite
Any reason for Kyrie not being put in at the end? 

Also good on the Nets for keeping it competitive against a a healthy 76ers
Alize Johnson straight up tackling people the whole fourth quarter
Kinda weird that KD and Harden are dodging furkan korkmaz but I do understand
I'd take any sloppy win over a loss any day, especially if it's a seeding tie-breaker. It's not just an ordinary regular season game.
An actual victory is better than a moral victory
Honestly both coaches made really poor choices at the end there...Nash had a timeout and could have put Kyrie in for a 3. 


Doc waiter too long to put his starters back in and almost choked again. Joel and Simmons actually saved his ass with those FT’s.

Talent of a team matters but both their coaching Patterns could easy cost them important games and series.

Other coaches are watching and will take note. Game planning against the coach is part of the playoffs as well.

Injuries and bad coaching often lead to playoff failures.  

Other than that..good shit by both Joel and Kyrie. They put on a show.
Nets can live with giving up 39 to Embiid if it takes him 29 shots
Thanksfully we won't have to play those role players in the playoffs
Oh man, i was feeling so bleak the first half of the 4th quarter then our boys went on a run

If only our 3's were falling!!

Gg see y'all in the playoffs
As a sixers fan not the best game but the kd sucks chants at the end made it all worth it.
Let's be honest Sixers fans, this was never going to be a feel good win. What if the backups held serve and we won by 22? What then? They didn't have Harden, Durant, or their mercs. Shit man even if Durant decided this game was more important than the Wolves game they still didn't have Harden. So are we really proving anything by beating just Kyrie? Did we really prove anything last time when we beat just Harden? Did they prove anything the time before that when a team that doesn't even really exist anymore beat the Sixers?

Obviously not. There were only three outcomes:

Sixers win easy: Who cares no one played for Brooklyn
Sixers win close: Lol you almost got beat by the third string Nets!
Sixers lose: Wow the Nets beat you and they didn't even need two of their big three. You guys are getting swept. 

There is nothing to take away other than two things we already knew. Kyrie is a great offensive player, and the Nets (like most teams) can't stop Embiid. 

Sixers didn't mess this up and got the win, the only tangible, concrete thing that came out of this game and the only tangible, concrete thing that was ever going to come out of this game once Harden re-injured his hamstring.
That was the best not trying to win a 1 vs 2 seed matchup since prime spurs. The nets really didn’t give a shit about this game at all.
The Nets made the Sixers sweat without any of their stars. He could've brought Kyrie back in but respect to Steve Nash for sticking to the lineup that made it happen
Embiid cannot be stopped, I cannot think of a single man who can stop him, he's just so fucking strong and can draw fouls at such an insane rate, along with scoring in so many different ways
Alize "the Bulldozer" Johnson literally just started charging headfirst into anyone and anything and it worked for some reason
People being mad over KD SOFT chants, he did make the decision to play the Wolves and not the Sixers. It is what it is.
+/- in this game were so weird.
Holy shit what a toxic wasteland of a game thread, I’ll take 4 games of that any day.
Good thing they rested KD for this sure loss
Excellent performance from the refs tonight. Really made sure their bets came through that good stuff.
This is where George Hill will be crucial
Well I am a fan of this Alize Johnson fella.
So the Sixers are much better this season than last, as anyone with a pair of eyes can tell, but I still feel like they haven't ironed out the wrinkles enough for me to think they're likely to beat the Nets in a 7 game series.

They need to stay focused on transition D--those are free buckets that can change a close game. They need to run around more when Joel is banging his way in--they watch too much. They need to play better help D so Joel isn't left on an island ever--which will absolutely hurt against the Nets when they have all 3 stars healthy. The Nets, per their reputation, really turned up the focus against their most likely rival and made this a game despite Harden and KD out. Props to the Sixers nonetheless. Gritty game. Loved it.
Embiid is the MVP if he doesn’t miss anymore games
I think we can all agree if there’s any takeaways from this game it’s that the Nets need to keep Kyrie on the bench for them to compete right guys?
Somehow the Nets won even though they lost.
Sixers almost choked to a nets team without kd and harden wow
Nets were allowed to play way more physical in that 4th quarter. Other than our bench being bad in that stretch, it was comfortable the first 3 games. 

Embiid needs to get out of that brace by postseason
Lmaooo everyone get in here
Sixers and somehow making a marquee win feel disappointing, name a more iconic duo.
Yeah the Nets are taking the east lmao
Love it or hate, there’s nothing surprising about the Philly responses in here.
Meh, Kyrie being sat for the last 6mins of a close prime time game is pathetic lol. Idc what anyone says, that’s a joke.
Nets going 12-0 vs east
The fact our depleted bench brought the game back against their starters and made them sweat is good enough for me
Y’all still think the sixers beating the nets? Lol
If there's such a thing as a bad win that was one of them
Why did Nash sit Kyrie? They could’ve won
bruh wtf was that 4th quarter are the sixers *trying* to give me a heart attack? god damn
People have to start talking about how great the nets bench is. Claxson is a monster and Bruce Brown is just good. Jeff Green also is a great offensive player. With all their guys missing yeah they dangerous
Whos gonna guard Embiid? Alize, but who's gonna guard him?
Someone remind Alize Johnson what fucking sport hes playing, dudes a headcase and hes gonna hurt someone one day
Nets way better when Kyrie went to the bench. Coincidence? I think not.
The Sixers should be embarrassed
Ben Simmons being ass on offense won't be talked about until its exploited in the post season. You hardly have to defend him.
Dogshit performance by sixers. 

Getting bailed out by refs and fucked by em is awful. 

Nets came out strong. GG. We absolutely need the 1st seed.
We've won but at what mental cost
this result is very concerning if you’re a Sixers fan and very encouraging if you’re a Nets fan, imo.
Whos gonna guard kyrie, kd, harden> who’s gonna guard embiid
Sixers are so defensive lmao it's fun to watch.
The Nets without their 2 best players just went toe to toe against a beast of the East. They're a fucking deep and terrifying team.
MVP Convo

*Joel Embiid has re-entered the thread*
Holy shit Sixers flairs are so defensive and chippy right now lol. I guess it's to be expected after barely scraping together a win against Kyrie and a bunch of G-leaguers
Hey fun game good job barely beating our third stringers guys!
Nets in 4-5 with the big 3
Everyone playing for 2nd place in the East lol. Nets are just way too good imo
The Nets looked like they went full in on the psychological warfare tonight. They sat damn near everybody and basically said to the 76ers, "You don't matter and this game don't matter."

And they still almost came back and won it.
Damn impressive effort by our third string. They nearly pulled off the win without Durant, Harden, Griffin, Aldridge, and Johnson
Yeah, we’re spanking this Nets team in the ECF. Idc about how their bench or our bench outshined each other. None of those people will play that much in the playoffs. GG Nets bros, try again next year
The nets are absolutely gonna assblast all of the teams in the east in the playoffs.

Once Harden and Durant play everything else is a formality.
God the Nets are gonna beak the fuck out of us in the playoffs. Nets in 5
Nets in 4 when healthy 😂😂
Ermagawd, the fact the Nets third stringers were punching the Sixers starters in the gut late in the game... What an effort. Nash threw this game away not putting Kyrie back in, he didn't want it. Ah well
Hospital Nets almost beat the Sixers without bringing back Kyrie, the disrespect lol. Embarrasing win and impressive loss.
I usually hate this take but The Sixers don’t have “the dog” in them like a team like the Lakers do. They lack fight and a bully mentality, Embiid played well but it felt like Andre Drummond was eating these guys up easier. To beat a finesse team like Brooklyn you need physicality and grit
Nets sweeping them, aren't they...
That's as good a loss as any team could hope for. 76ers won the night, but Brooklyn is the team walking away feeling confident after tonight's match up.
Best loss ever
My god Kyrie, play in the game
I can not wait until technology makes the referees obsolete. 

Watching them blow a couple dozen calls a game jussi gets so frustrating
Need to see these two teams healthy. Hope the NBA gods will be in our favor
Can’t tell who wanted the Nets to win more in the 4th, the Sixers or the refs
The 76ers did not make a FG in the last 9:30 of this game
Nets team total 3-pointers: 4

7'2" Center's 3-pointers: 3
Think the Nets may have found something at the end in terms of putting quickness on Embiid and hard doubling under 10 on the shot clock. 

You can play 1on1 with a traditional big like DeAndre which they did as the original game plan, but the fronting/selective doubling allows the nets to play 3-point shooters in all 5 spots on the other end if Philly doesn't make you pay defensively. That might be the way to go when it counts in the playoffs
that last quarter was so sixers basketball lmao 20+ advantage gone mime the wind
Let bball scrap
Kyrie is something else.
The Nets are perfect...on paper. What could possibly go wrong with that plan?
honestly not even mad. ben simmons won’t be a legit offensive threat in the playoffs, so we’ll be able to double embiid easier while they’ll have to figure out how to guard our trio.
They really took their top contender in the East to within 6 points with just 1 kyrie lmao
Sixers ain’t winning a game against the Nets if they are fortunate enough to even meet them in the PS.
Ggs easy dub during an 8v5.  Sixers own this franchise
It feels so weird rooting for the Sixers to get the one seed, but it is the Celtics best chances. God I hate it. This season has been so weird, I’ve also ended up rooting for the Lakers against teams like the Knicks and Hornets, I hate this so much.
Yeah nets are deadly
What happened to Seth? He's fallen off since returning
When Harden and KD come back, this game is over.
Did I miss something? Tobias was our second best player tonight where was he in the 4th
I mean I’ll take the tiebreaker I guess
Eh not a great game for most of the Sixers and they still had a 21 point lead in the 4th. In the playoffs the bench won’t be given the opportunity to blow a lead and give up a 18-2 run. The most concerning part of this game was that Simmons was really ineffective in the half court again.
Alize Johnson is our secret Embiid stopper. I'll take that. 

2nd game of a back to back, missing 2 stars + 3 rotation guys. I liked the effort.
Nets got to feel good here their bench made a great run even without their main guys
For anyone creating hot takes based on this game, see above. Dwight (who has actually been great off the bench) and George Hill) will at the *bare minimum* change the dynamic to the extent it will render whatever opinion you're looking to glean from this game useless.

Oh and the fact that like every fucking Nets starter didn't play. Absolutely nothing to learn here realistically.
Everyone on the Sixers except Joel, Ben and Tucker have a positive +/-.
Howard signing was the best thing Morey did, IMO. More important than curry trade. Embiid has never had a competent backup to get some rest and it’s showing.
He was really bad there for a while
Tolliver hasn't played a game yet and I'm already investing Scott minutes to him lol.
FREE BBALL PAUL
I'm looking at you Ben!
[deleted]
I blame Docs gameplan, the last few plays were handoff from Simmons to Furkan then entry pass to Embiid.

When they’re hard doubling you can’t give it to him in the corner like that, I’m hoping in the ‘yoffs they’ll have better planning
Simmons is his sidekick. He's not really doing anything on offense besides being a facilitator. We really needed a guy like Lowry.
Basically this
Thank you for being the first realistic nets fan in this thread😂

There is no takeaway from this game other than the sixers hold the one seed for now. Games are going to look completely different with shorter benches and healthy players
Thanks for actually watching the game and understanding what happened instead of 90% of the commenters in this thread
Kind of respected that. Stick with the guys that brought them back and reward them for what they had done
That demoralizing for the players that actually got you to that point. They were hot, might as well keep them rolling
Shows a lot of faith in the young guys who got them back in it. Will do wonders for their confidence.

That's the bs coachspeak reason, but I figure the real reason is Nash told Kyrie he was done for the night when he took him out. It's probably risking some kind of soft tissue injury to throw a guy back in at crunchtime after he thinks he's done. With the existing KD/Harden injury issues and Kyrie's propensity to get hurt, I can understand the move. Though it would have been fucking amazing to pull this off and get the #1 seed tiebreaker. Tough call
More humiliating to let the 3rd stringers keep doing their thing
That was either a power move by Nash or he straight up just doesn’t give a fuck lol
That was absolutely the move IMO.
Kyrie was out for personal reasons
It was a mental game. So good. It reminded me of Doc blowing those Clippers leads last bubble. Some things never change
Nash toying
Total alpha move
Usuaully the case, but I dont agree with that on a first year coach.
Korkmaz never makes three FTs in a row. It's honestly impressive at this point. Because he leads our team in fouls on three pointers.
Nets players were all smiling and laughing after the game like they won lmao
This game was so hilarious lol.
Nets from 3: 4/21 (19%)


Sixers from 3: 13/28 (46.4%)


Very normal and sustainable performance from both teams relative to how they play.
It is, lol. I've never been so happy after a loss
Seriously.
[Shamet checking the Eastern conference standings](https://i.redd.it/feh7yy36llc41.jpg)
Absolutely, I went into this game expecting to lose a lot of confidence. This is going to be an easy playoff matchup, especially because nets weren’t even going for the double on embid which we all know will happen with Simmons on the floor.
The Nets bench put in work tonight, it was great to see
Yea doc loves those all bench units wayy too much
yeah but it was one of those they were beating the hell out of them up like 22 and then took their foot off the gas and it got a little too close
Why are people so obsessed with games when stars didn’t play? If this is a win for the Nets then what’s losing to the lakers bench when KD and Kyrie did play significant minutes?
And the Nets shot 4/21 from 3
Obviously Kyrie should be cut
Single game plus minus is always a reliable stat
+/- for single games are for clowns like you
You are an idiot lol
So you really believe we are better without Kyrie?
When when kyrie is the only one playing he's 3 and 5. He only lost to 6ixers today and the bulls
Yea, I saw that as a Nets fan and was confused af. Luckily the Nets didn't score otherwise I'm sure the sixers sub would've lost it.
Replay of it?
[deleted]
simmons legit holds and hacks on half his possessions lmao. if someone gets physical with him then he threw his hands up
How dare you have a reasonable comment.
Yeah you could tell they thought they were done. Trying to warm back up while hungry ass back of the roster dudes go 120% on the other end.
already used to it
Its the little things
Lose to the Lakers bench with stars playing: this game means nothing

Lose a competitive game to Sixers without stars: this is a huge win for the Nets
That’s Doc’s biggest weakness and Joel needs to make sure it doesn’t happen if he wants to win a championship.

Do you really want to be clowned like the clippers were?
A Philly team being underdogs throughout the entire playoffs despite dominating all season and obtaining the 1 seed?

Yea I’ll take it.
>I never feel good about being people’s favorite

Your team is literally no one's favourite to win anything, don't worry lol
Lol yeah I’m glad u like being the underdog bc u are. Gonna need a Herculean effort to even win a game against the nets
Why the hell would this game mean you are the favorites?? 

We did not give zero fucks about winning this game and had two MVP's on the bench.
I think Nash viewed it as a moral win for the bench guys. They got us in the game they should finish it you. You should know that after that classic Hardenless Clippers comeback.
Healthy? We were missing the one and only ejection expert, the illegal screen invincible, Dwight Howard.
He wasn’t on the 5 that made the game close.
Dude does look like lamar jackson
Furkan is going to be a problem for the NBA in 2 -3 years.
Yes
They can count those moral victories as Giannis dunks on Blake’s head for the 6th time in a game 6 close out
Doc has always been an overrated coach. I wouldnt trust him leading a team during the playoffs. Nash has a lot to prove, I would argue he left the guys on the court because they are the ones that pulled them close in this game and stayed with the hot hands.
Meh, he’s fine, but in my opinion nurse, and maybe your guy, are the only plus coaches in the league
A bad night from Embiid and he still got 39, I’ll take it
Would’ve been much lower if he took out DJ earlier. Alize and Clax were holding him down admirably. He’s not scoring more than 35 a night if we face them in the playoffs.
Yes you’ll only have KD harden and kyrie to worry about, shouldn’t be hard
Same
There have been plenty of playoff series that begin with a team winning by 20+.  Those blowouts don’t mean anything, so why would ANY regular season game mean anything?  I never feel good or bad about any single game result.
If they want to play the Bucks in the second round more power to them.
Lakers bench beat the Nets last week.  It’s like teams stop trying when they’re playing backups and forget even the backups in the NBA are some of the best players in the world and capable of getting hot on any given night.
Lol the sixers aren’t doing shit to this team. Hilarious they think they stand a chance in the playoffs
Nets don't need to stop him to win they got 3 of the greatest scorers ever
nets bench in the 4th quarter comes to mind
How many times did he shoot tonight?
G league double teams
The issue is fouls come harder in the playoffs and the doubles come more. The rest of your team needs to earn your playoff victories.
If embiid is scoring 39 points on 29 shots a night the nets will easily win in 5.
Dude is soft. Half his points come from the free throw line
Steven Adams
Last 2 minutes of the game were the 76ers being flattened for no apparent reason
So he pulled a Ben Simmons
True that. Brooklyn might even push it to five if they're not too gassed from the Bucks series.
losing > injured KD
And Dwight
Bench did well earlier. When they gave up the lead Hill probably also would've been on the bench. We were a few points away from Maxey getting on the court for Shake.
Man out there playing like he has a J instead of an N on his jersey. MF straight up tackling players smh
Safer to just cut him tbh.
Donovan?
we lost the game....that was entertaining at the end but a loss is a loss. No such thing as moral victories, gtfo with this bs
They somehow covered the -7/-8 spread! 💰💰💰
No, they still lost.lol
If you consider being 1 game behind in the standings a win you are right
sixers fans in the responses: NO STOP HAVING FUN YOURE SUPPOSED TO FEEL BAD
Nope got your ass beat
did they?
Sometimes when you win, you actually lose, Billy.
They led literally the entire game and outscored Brooklyn in 3 of the 4 quarters.
Almost only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades
And Kyrie. He sat when the sixers were up by like 20
I will take Embiid in that brace if it’s an insurance policy against another injury. It looks limiting and annoying, but he’s still playing at an MVP level with it.
It’s a fucking salt mine in here
Korkmaz and going 1 for 2 at the line.
Weird conclusion to get from that Sixers win
If they’re healthy they’re taking more than the East
They just lost to the Lakers without their stars. Played well against the Sixers but literally these regular season games do not mean much. Just appreciate that it was a competitive game at the end and I’m so excited to see the playoff matchup
Shit reminds me of 2017, I’m rooting for an upset but man.. just unfair
No they’re not...Sixers get zero respect from this sub constantly. That Brooklyn team is a joke...they can’t play defense
RemindMe! 3 months
East still runs through Cleveland
What’s pathetic is that game was even close. We put in garbage time and almost beat their starters. Lol.
They didn’t start the comeback against the starters.
Oh shit r/NBA wake the fuck up it's time to overreact!
Yup.
Yes
Like the Heat are any better?
Yep.
Yup
I didn't, but after seeing Embiid in this game I kinda do now
The only question is do they take a game or not
Nets defense is bad so they probably will
This comment obviously comes from a Celtics fan lmfao
Celtics fan? You would be chanting this win from the roof tops
Wish he would have put him in but this was a big confidence boost for our third string. Would have been incredible to get the W
alize definitely did a good job holding him
I love Alizes physicality and effort, but it did feel like towards the end he was just straight up tackling people lmao
NBA Basketball 1989 edition :). But yeah I agree the refs called all of those fouls appropriately. He's was like a bullet bull from the mario games.
Bro TLC on the court is having like having 4 players for the nets. Dude is legit useless on both ends of the court, and the only reason he’s getting minutes is because nets are injured
If you unironically believe this...

It’s almost as if taking your foot off the gas when you see bench players in the game is a real thing.
No shit. Kyrie doesn’t even know he has 4 other teammates when he has the ball
Eh we took out all of our starters to be fair
A win in a key tiebreaker game? Yeah man fuming, might go send doc some hate mail
Needed a win, got a win
Less embarrassing than your team
Hey pot I wanna introduce you to my friend kettle
We got a win, something your team has struggled to do all season
I mean there’s absolutely zero reason for Lebron not to be guarding Simmons if he meets in the playoffs. 

Lakers can actually contain/slowdown Joel with Drummond and AD. 

Nash just didn’t have the right defensive gameplan even though he has probably one of the best rosters/benches in the league. 

Either way...the teams in the west are definitely prepared to shut down simmons.

Lakers,Suns,Clippers and Jazz all have the tools to challenge neutralize Embiied and Simmons. Which if that happens...Tobias has to start making plays and getting tough shots. 

Also as far as playoffs goes Brad,Spo and Bud have shown themselves to be better coaches than both Rivers and Nash.
Eh, it was pretty much a blowout before the bench went in and started blowing the lead. Refs also heavily favored the nets today.
Calling this "very concerning" is idiotic. It was a win and put us in sole control of 1st
Not discouraged at all. The majority of that run there was nets bench vs Sixers bench. Mostly guys on both sides who will see very limited time. 

No one knows what the real matchup is so we don’t know how it’s gonna look.
Simmons
Thybulle
Green
Embiid
Howard
I get what you're saying, but out of all the teams, the Sixers actually have some solid defenders to throw in there. Harris's defense I thought was also excellent tonight
Do you mean fans are getting defensive? Or the team is defensive? Both are probably true.
“Toe to toe” doesn’t mean bench vs bench for 8 minutes lol

Realistically, nobody knows how a Sixers vs Nets matchup will go because they haven’t played a single game(both teams at full strength) a against each other
Bucks had to win in OT against an injured Sixers team, what does this say about the Bucks then?
“Toe to Toe” the sixers was up 22 points until their bench blew the lead
And the Nets with everyone but Harden just got blown out by the Andre Drummond led Lakers four days ago. They played really tonight, really poorly then. Shouldn't overreact too much in either direction.
Deep? we're as deep as a fucking kiddy pool.
I’ll take a win man
We lost to them last time, beat Harden and beat Kyrie
Because they were down 19 when he left the game?
i mean i dont think any sixers fans are gonna brag about this win, and if they do they should be smacked
Just like the Lakers in the standings
I kindly refer you to the standings
Lol you can literally smell the panic in this post
Did you forget 5 key players sitting out. Two of them former mvps? Lmao.. yall sour af
Just like how the Sixers assblasted the mavs every matchup this season
I don’t like your attitude
We were up 22 and pulled the starters. It was a blowout until the bench played ur bench
They really think they don’t need to play together before the playoffa
They lost and didn't play three of their best players, they shouldn't feel more confident lmao
Lol refs literally looked like they were being paid by the sixers in the first quarter. Maybe they just suck.
lol wow didn't even notice we only had 4 and attempted 19, so odd.
Crying face behind smiling mask
You say dumb shit hourly
did he get covid too?
I think he got a bit injured in the end there. He started limping a bit
I'm only half joking when I say Dwight has been as much of an upgrade to the team as Green or Curry. The 76ers' need at backup center during the Embiid era has been staggering.
People are dumb, it's just a regular season game.

But they'll still act dumb in the playoffs, people are too reactionary after every game. Well whatever, it's still entertaining I guess. 

Nets and Sixers are looking like the top 2 seeds, knock on wood, so it would be an ECF matchup. Long way to go, and someone's gotta get past the Bucks.
I do think the one to take away is Joe Harris might struggle against good defenses in the playoffs. He has in the past, could barely get a shot off against philly last year. And tonight it happened again.

He'll have more space and less focus when the big 3 are out there of course but still something to keep an eye on. I have a feeling Brown will be playing a lot with the starting unit
irrelevant but damn dude youre good with words
And by some mathematical impossibility, has the best +/- of the night with +7
He’s been really bad for like 2+ years at this point. I love the dude but I cannot believe that he’s still getting minutes on this team. Just give BBall Paul those minutes, he cannot be worse. If he is over several games, go back to Scott. Not like you’re spoiling his rhythm, he doesn’t have any.
But hey, he ain't no bitch
The league aint ready!!!
I might be losing my mind but I think I saw Ben pass the ball to a doubled Embiid AFTER Embiid passed out of the double team.
You're looking at him just standing there  looking at embiid
That’s if George Hill is actually a real person or not
> George Hill will be huge for this team. 

Whenever he decides to join us on the court lol
Doc has no plan, he just plays his guys and talks politics
Tobias has been more of Embiid's Robin. Ben is more like Catwoman, he's there to make them look sexy.
> We really needed a guy like Lowry.

You mean the guy who has averaged 12/4/6 since the trade deadline while missing 8 of the 12 games his team has played? Is this the guy you are talking about? Sure, Simmons hasn't been much better stat wise but at least he's a first team all defender and isn't 35yo...
yup. this game means absolutely zero for the matchup in the playoffs in terms of whos gonna win.

i do think the nets got some decent info on what could work against embiid or not. Nothing concrete but they got to test out some different strats against him, Dj, going small etc. ur not gonna stop him but some idea on what our best moves would be. sending a trap on him with a guy like durant/clax could be a move, the length seemed to work better than traps from small guys.

one benefit for the nets is sixers probably dont get much info on this game outside on maybe different ways to guard kyrie.
People on r/nba don’t watch games they just look at final/box scores
Kyrie was playing really well though
Yeah but there’s gotta be one guy out there who’s playing just ok. Switch him with Kyrie and reward the rest
This is cute but that is not how it works.
Your first point made more sense than your second
Dude it was for a minute of play, that reasoning makes absolutely zero sense
We won? Doc didn’t blow the lead? So things do change? What the hell is this
Nash?  He denied it before the game.  Said those type things usually backfire.
I mean shit lmao they played with their 3rd stringers and almost got the win lmao
Oh believe me, this tight loss felt more like a win than the tight wins over Detroit, Knicks, etc...
Scary tho
The nets shot pretty bad from 3 but Joe Harris I believe has also consistently shot below his average in most games against the sixers over his career.
Nets obviously underperformed but Sixers aren’t a bad shooting team. Everybody besides Simmons and Dwight are respectable to good shooters. Hitting over 40% as a team is definitely within the realm of possibility for them in any game.
Yeah, I brought that up in the game thread.  Not only were the Nets missing KD/Harden, they shot like absolute dogshit from 3 and the Sixers overperformed there.  That's prone to happen in 1 or 2 games, but it's highly unlikely to happen more than that over the course of a 7 game series.

I think the Embiid will still dominate teams in the playoffs but I think the offense will stagnate in the playoffs as well.  

I guess the more I watch, I just don't love how Doc runs offenses.  There's no real creativity or anything at all, it was very similar in LA last year.  It's stagnant and predictable, even with an absolute monster of a player in Embiid.
I’ve def been happier after Knicks losses.
It was fun watching the Sixers sweat lol
Loser, your team got fucking spanked
Bucks in 5
Bucks Sixers ECF 🔥🔥🔥
And completely without Dwight Howard tonight. Just not a solid strategy at all.
The last 3 games the starters haven't even played the 4th quarter, he just runs the 2nd unit.
The bench did a good job holding the lead, better than the starters at the end
Yea. Anyone who thinks this was a “way to close game, Sixers should have won by more.” Didn’t really watch.  It was just a standard “got to comfortable” game. Not really sure this tells us shit about a 7 game playoff series.
KD played 23 minutes, kyrie got ejected in that game. Honestly that was an even bigger accomplishment for lakers then this because we had a decent amount of our bench.

In this game we are missing 5+ ppl then Nets without kyrie in the end made this a 6 point loss.
Lakers fans acted like it was a championship on this sub. It’s the regular season. These games don’t really matter too much
When Kyrie got kicked out of that game it was a loss immediately tbh
That was still considered a loss in our book but no harden and kd in 19 mins is a huge factor still, kyrie also didnt play  in the second half
Buyout then Detroit picks him up
Better yet, get traded for a 3 & D guy
It's the Celtics all over again.
Are you telling me Mike Scott wasn't the Sixers' best player tonight?
4 serious replies to this post in 5 minutes lets see how many we can rack up
hi kyrie
You worship a man who don’t even know you exist
hey it's the ref!! you're why we watch, bro. keep up the good work
Lol
Simmons never flops lmao its a problem because he would get more calls, but I think its a pride thing
Whats so funny is that if the bench didnt go on that run then we get clowned because embiid had a big night. this game means nothing either way.
Oh absolutely don’t get me wrong I don’t feel great after this game
My thoughts exactly
They are philly fans favorite to win lol But yea, not many people have them as a favorite let alone being the team coming out of the east
Good thing we have the closest thing to Hercules, Joel Embiid baby
Can you guys go jerk eachother in your own sub?
39 on 29 is not bad night. he had 11 free throws so he had like around 34-35 possessions for 39 shots which is still moderately efficient, about a 58% true shooting. First half he wasnt tthat efficient, second he was fantastic.

Not really back breaking for the nets. what really killed us is how great tobias harris was in the first half and the 3pt shooting from korkmaz and milton in that second half.
On 29 shots that’s shit. He’s gotta post up more and stop taking step backs like he’s good at those. He looks a little fat now too ngl maybe that’s why
Bet
Why does everyone assume they are going to be healthy?
Yeah the Nets scored 117 without them. So with them they'll score about 167 right? That's how it works you just add their ppg to the score right?
If they’re all healthy at the same time, sure
Exactly. The main things in regular season games are did anyone get injured and who won. That's really it.
It's likely partly psychological. But I think once coaches look into analytics they'll prolly find to no one's surprise that having fresh bench players with more energy could actually be a competitive advantage late in the game.

I think teams with super star point guards like harden or cp3 might be potentially better off swapping in 3 well rested bench role players to close out games if they can get physical without fouling.
Unless you are the Warriors, Warriors have a G league team without Steph
Yet the Nets still got blown out by an AD and LeBron-less Lakers🤔🤔🤔
Why do you cry about the 76ers on every thread, talk about living rent free lmfao
Have fun with the 10 year rebuild and waiting to evaluate the gm 😀
I can’t wait to come back to this comment
Enjoy the pick swaps
Fax they should’ve given up everything for harden he was there only chance
Embiid going to put up 40ppg+ in a series against the Nets and still get swept.
Calling Kyrie one of the greatest scorers ever is utterly ridiculous. Dude is good but c'mon man....that's crazy talk bud
Luckily he’ll play the starters in the playoffs
Lol
Our trio of Alize, Clax and Bruce could
I believe it was 29 times
Joel has historically shot more free throws in the playoffs.
You nets fans are hilarious
10/39 = 50%, math checks out
You should try finding someone that can guard him then
He's not soft tho? He draws fouls because he's not afraid to get to the hoop, yeah ill admit he flops at times but he is not soft
How is driving in the paint and getting fouled soft? Actually smooth brain take.
Smart play by Shamet to recognize this I'm real time and just blatantly throw Simmons to the ground to try and score. Surprised he didn't score tbh, good professional recovery by the team, because there's no way I would've been doing anything other than screaming at the ref while jumping up and down like a petulant child.
Lmao sixers are gonna be lucky to win a half let alone 4 games against the nets
Lmaoooo okay bro
I think he's implying that he could have played tonight and not last night. Could be wrong though.
If you're a Sixers fan you knew which way to bet that spread...
OK, but what if you count the superdelegates
people really acting like they haven't seen teams take their foot off the gas before despite it happening all the time. I don't think the sixers are likely to win with their lack of perimeter creation but this 4th quarter is pretty meaningless
Curling
A team playing better without Kyrie? Huh, would you [look](https://i.imgur.com/M1WgUaY.jpg) at [that](https://i.imgur.com/lcIK4I8.jpg).
Lets ignore the missing players, the Nets shot 19% from 3 and lost by 6. Yea the Nets are going to steam roll the East.
Am I crazy to think even if they are missing one of their big 3, they still take it all?
I will root for anyone against the upset (upset against the Nets) except Philly or Lakers.
The Sixers got pressed by the Nets without Kd, Harden, and Kyrie on the bench in the 4Q
Nets were 13th in dtrg since the all-star break before this game. This was without one of our best defenders in Durant for a lot of it. This idea that we don't play defense is laughable
Doesn’t matter, they’ll be good enough. You guys act like they’re the worst defensive team in the NBA
The Sixers nearly lost to the Nets without Harden, Kd, and Aldridge. You're going to be very disappointed come playoff time.
If Harden and Durant are 100% they won't need to play great defense to beat the eastern teams in a series.  The Lakers are the only team in the league right now that will give them a real fight in a series.
They won't need defense where theyre going
Duh
Shhh don't spoil the moral victory
Oh yeah? Well I think you'll lose
how?
Delusional
Ur on something bud. Y’all would get waxed in 3
you guys let the nets b team come back from 20. even with Kyrie alone they were close the entire first half. Now add Harden and KD, laughable lol
What does Miami have to do with anything. Everyone’s saying the sixers are the only team with a chance to beat the nets in the east
How is that relevant?  

Oh, you are deflecting.
You watched this game and came out feeling that Embiid alone is enough to win a series against Kyrie Irving, James Harden, and Kevin fucking Durant?
39 points on 29 shots convinced you? Lmao
Do they take a half is the real question
He’s not wrong though ngl
It’s okay - they don’t have many wins, so they just like to talk about other teams’
Hopefully this is a demonstrating game for Alize and he can get more quality minutes going forward.
"Alize? Do you mind not bumping the prima-donna superstars? We got calls from three agents that their clients said they have boo-boos"
Yet people will still use that 4th quarter to argue the Nets are definitely better than the Sixers
He had 9 assists?

who the fuck you want him to be passing to when Landry Shamet is the only other guy on the court who can dribble the damn ball. Classic Philadelphia intelligence
same level I would think
both fair and accurate points, but I’m more talking about the fact that Kyrie got pretty much whatever he wanted and that the Sixers really didn’t open up a big lead until late in the game, despite both KD and Harden being out

EDIT: also want to mention that the Nets honestly played very good defense on Embiid. 39 points on 29 shots is about as good as you can do on him
Refs will be the same in the playoffs or worse
Nets did cut it down to 3 even when both Embiid and Simmons were in, granted Harris wasn't in at that time.
If they heavily favored the nets they would have won but instead they bailed your team out in the 4th because they couldn’t make a fg in the final 8 minutes of the game
they did a really good job on Embiid defensively, and despite being the only real scoring threat out there for Brooklyn Kyrie dropped an efficient 37. at full strength I’m pretty sure Brooklyn would’ve won this comfortably which should be concerning bc you’re more than likely gonna have to go through the Nets to get to the Finals, and home court isn’t gonna be a big deal this year with the limited fan attendance
You act like I care about being 4-5 in standings. Playoffs only thing that matter
Lol means shit when sixers get bounced by them in the play-offs.
Who’s panicking? We’re bulldozing the Nets. I’ll gladly eat crow if we don’t. I’m a gaucho, and a man of my word.
NYC turnstiles play better defense than those players. Sixers in 6
Woah...  so salty
What about last night made you think anything different? George Hill will be nice when he gets back but he's not exactly KD and Harden. It's okay to have a realistic appraisal of the situation and know that that team is just so much better than us. No shame in losing to a much better team
Embiid and Simmons both finished as a -1 for the game. It’s not like putting them back in made much of a difference at the end there
Not unless you think they'll get worse when all three are on the court? What the Nets needed to do this season was find a solid supporting group behind their top three players, I think they've accomplished that.
You're saying they shouldn't feel confident about a 6 point loss off a b2b, missing four of their best players?
yes
Kawhi's shot haunts me way less than the +/- of Embiid in that game considering he sat less than *two motherfucking minutes*.
Yeah he's not meant to be a playmaker but has been forced into that role. I've been fairly surprised with his dribble drive midrange but his best role is definitely the floor spacing sniper, without question.
Exhibit 7473829283 why single game plus/minus is a stupid stat and no box score should include it.
No way. That seems crazy.
"Hax! I call hax!"
He’ll join the team as soon as Saric comes over
What’s up with that? Why is he still not playing? Health and safety?
Mona lisa is sexy?
If anyone fits the Alfred meme perfectly, it's Simmons.
wait you a nets fan? what the .. dude?!
We were not trading Simmons for Lowry.

You ok my guy?😂🤣
We did not get any info on how to guard kyrie he torched every one of our good defenders lmao all of them had some good defensive plays on him SOME but I guess some is really all you can ask for when it comes to kyrie
yeah but defense is what kept them in it and kyrie would've just gotten abused
well Nash cited reinjury possibility as a reason as well, so take it up with him
Did he not though? Y’all were up 20 and almost lost to our 3rd stringers. If KD and Harden would have been here it would have been over
Gotcha. I dont think he has the experience to really have different game plans.
We just call him The Lesser Harris
Some reversion to the mean coming for Embiid. He’s a lifetime sub-33% shooter. Otherwise why isn’t he taking every single open 3?
I think it’s generally really hard to prevent offensive stagnation for any team whose primary scorer is a below average ballhandler and playmaker. Just creates a lot of vulnerabilities to trapping, doubles, etc. There’s a reason the #1 option on almost every finals team is a good passer.
https://streamable.com/xa4poz
Hahahahaha
Today I learned losing by six is getting spanked
lol nets in 5
Brah the Nets lost by six missing two players that are both better players than the best player on the Sixers.
lmfao
Lol 76er fans when the bucks beat sixers with no Embiid: “We didn’t have embiid though”

76er fans when they beat the Nets with no Harden and KD on minutes restrictions “your team got fuckin spanked”
Spanked? Should've given up Maxey buddy, the second we got Harden is the second you guys have no shot at making it out of the East. Imagine allowing Tyrese Maxey be the reason you let the already loaded Brooklyn Nets get James Harden lmfao
Please
I hope, I really like Giannis and if he takes you guys in 5, that would be amazing.
That's a weird way to spell Magic.
No cap that would make me happy if Giannis could lead them to a win. But, I just can’t see that as the ECF happening.
Holding the lead? We were bleeding points already the nets had momentum
the box score watchers have come out of the woodwork
Most important stat from the night was minutes for Embiid and Kyrie. Would have liked to see Embiid's under 30 but Kyrie wasn't having any of that.
You were up by 12 with the starters in, definitely way too close
It does show that the Nets are a lot deeper than the 76ers
It was 3 points with 1:20 left lmao sixers fans are hopeless
And all the comments for this game is “this is a huge win for the Nets”
It doesn't matter, but when you take into account that the Sixers shot unusually well from 3, and the Nets shot unusually poorly from 3, it really puts the game into perspective. Of course, I won't look too much into this because it's only a regular season game and Sixers certainly let their guard down (Although the Nets did keep coming back even with Simmons and Embiid in), I think their still interesting considerations.
He’s the real MVP of the sixers
I wasn’t serious either lol
And you think the great Brandon Ellis knows who you are?
Nurse,Spo,Brad and Vogel are all good enough coaches to pull off a win in that situation or possibly make it more close.

Just saying...good win but coaching can easily be the difference in a playoff series.
Lmfao if that helps u fall asleep at night then kee thinking that
Soft
I guess I meant for Embiid’s standards, it was a bad night. But yeah in general that’s a fine night for most players
I think the "fat" is a combination of extra muscle, cream colored jerseys, and that massive brace on his leg; he's waaaaay more in shape than he used to be
thats not shitty at all 39 on 29 shots is pretty normal
He looks exactly like he has all season. He’s clearly still not 100% with his knee. His shot wasn’t falling and the refs let Jordan get away with a ton early on and the Nets still struggled to stop him. He’s got a lot of time to get healthy for the playoffs and in the playoffs I’m not worried about Doc letting the bench choke away a 21 point lead.
Lmao he’s putting up the most efficient season for a big man in 20 years, I think he’s doing just fine
go to bed kid
Low effort troll. Try again.
Where’s everyone saying this when Donovan Mitchell does the same thing
Idk why but that last sentence just made me crack up laughing
I guess we could say the same about embiid then, I just assume both teams will be healthy.
They think the Nets are just chilling and none of these injuries are real. They're just holding Durant and Harden out for funsies, not because they are legitimately concerned that they could get re-injured or won't be 100% come playoff time.
Sixers are the underdogs in a nets matchup barring injuries, that’s just how it is. 3 superstars vs 1 superstar is a lopsided matchup. You can try and straw man me but it doesn’t change reality
Role players who haven’t played much in the game can also be super aggressive on defense because they wont be in foul trouble.
In a game where none of the big 3 played fully. Means so much
I mean if you were a Rockets fan wouldnt you be reaaaaaaaaaally bored right now?
Does it upset you?
Have fun getting pounded by the nets every season
And cry?
You can come back after game 4 of whatever series you meet the nets in, I guarantee you won’t though
It’s worth it knowing harden and co will be shitting on you for the foreseeable future
Sixers have the second best defense in the league. These dudes are MVP level scorers, but they don't shoot 100% and it's not like they are exactly the same against bad defenses as they are against good ones lol.
You never know with Kyrie
Can't forget the final piece of the quartet, blind refs
Classic 15 year old fanboying over his teams rival. Go to bed.

Don't know why you're so pressed when your team wasn't even involved
lol twolves fan who just wanted a chance
yeah bro Bernies got this in the bag
They must not watch much Sixer games. This has been a great year for our bench and they still do this once every 3-4 games.
Bruh that’s a terrible take. The article is bring January. Dude was 50%+ shooting and played 33 of the 48 minutes. Being the only legit star on your team during the game means your on the court more often, and coupled with everyone else on your team being ass and being being beat by an almost healthy sixers team (their key players were all healthy) means you Gonna have a bad +/-. I’m surprised it’s not more considering nets were down 21 at one point
If they steamroll the East they are steamrolling the finals too
Yes, because bench vs bench is exactly how the playoffs will be
Nah you just don’t know the Sixers script.

Good team at full strength = Sixers looking great

Bad/ depleted teams = closer than it ever should be
nets just lost to the lakers d team. See how that works?
Ok and the lakers demolished the nets without ad or Lebron my point is regular season doesn’t mean shit
The Nets lost to the Lakers with nobody, guess Nets are fake and they’ve got no chance against LA
Didn’t KD and Kylie just lose to the lakers bench? Guess they’re fake starters then too right
Sixers in 6 over the Nets in ECF...there, I said it.
So if there's a separate bench vs. bench playoff series then I'm sure the Nets are gonna whomp Philly. Congrats.
They give up 114ppg...that’s the second most in the East behind Washington which gives up over 118ppg...
It was a blowout until garbage time. Sit down
Yes you're right I think you'll lose
This game was close because the Nets bench outscored the Philly bench. I don't think that'll happen in the playoffs.
By wanting it more
Why Am I delusional
Your all over this thread lmao I thought knicks fans were supposed to hate the nets all of your comments are hating on Philly lmao
Do you realize they came back when it was an all bench line-up??
And the Nets lost to the Lakers without AD or Lebron lol just shows anything can happen.

I hate the 76ers but people are stupid if they think the Nets have automatically won the East.
Yes bc after leading pretty much the whole game they played down the stretch the same way they would have if KD & Harden were playing.... it’s completely different circumstances, Sixers lineups, etc.
We had a full bench unit in for most of the 4th quarter
B teams dont play in the playoffs. This is irrelevant
The sixers have no chance because they went up 20 on the starters but almost lost the big lead to the backups?  I mean you can make many arguments for why the nets would win a series but this doesn’t seem to be one of them.
If its a forgone conclusion the nets are winning it all the don't watch
NBA flair = coward
Yes.
Sixers fans in shambles
Not Embiid alone of course, but as far as I'm concerned the game ended when we were up 22 and took out the starters
yes? did you watch the game? or were you convinced by that fluky 4th quarter?
It wouldn’t call it a bad win by any means. Ugly? Sure. Bad? We were up by 22 before our whole bench mob choked a big part of that lead.
Considering he blew by his defender and everyone collapses I’m sure guys were open for 3’s. How many assists were lobs to DJ?
38-17 > 29-26 everyday of the week. They’ve lost 9 less games.
You are drawing a conclusion for the nets vs sixers from a regular season game goofball
Whatever helps you sleep at night brotha
Is that being salty? lol
They stopped a 16-2 run dead in their tracks. I think it made a difference. If they played the full 4th it would’ve been a 13-15 pt win
If you want to feel confident about a loss and losing 1st place go for it
Yeah that's how I've always felt too. Kawhi hit an all time shot, had to happen against someone. 

But greg fucking monroe, holy fuck that was just wildly unfortunate.
I believe Greg Monroe was -12 in 2:30. Truly astonishing. Then Embiids play was criticized like he wasn’t by far our best player.
But Dario is never coming over.
You clearly haven’t seen her nudes
Have you ever considered seriously why she was smiling ?
All you need to know about his endless hot takes and numerous burners resides in that flair.
well u learned what didnt work lol.
When he’s cooking like he has been all season it’s really just about making his shot a little more uncomfortable and not giving the open look. His efficiency this year is stupid.
On the flip side, Kyrie in the game could've easily hit a 3 or two, and Nets steal the game.
And Shamet provides more defense than Kyrie? Come on now.
I've noticed our defense is noticeably weaker when kyrie is on the court. He's prolly better than tlc and cheese, but of our other hustle guys just have more gas in the tank to run around on the defensive side of the court as opposed to kyrie who's running circles around on the offensive side.

I can't wait until harden is back though. Our teams entire stamina gets much better conserved when he's running the offense and people aren't doing as much running around in circles.

Philly balled hard for 3 quarters and pillaged us. But I started seeing cracks in embiids armor as he got more fatigued. Hoping we use the double team strategy more in the 4th in future matchups.
Can you re read what you typed? You said “some things never change” referring to doc blowing leads when he literally just did not blow a lead???? So they do change?  

And did you just start watching basketball? What about last week when the lakers bench with no AD or Lebron beat you with Kyrie and KD? Does that mean The lakers would sweep you?
He used to take terrible shots. Selectivity alone is going to boost his numbers. He’s got great form, it’s just a slow release.
His shooting is super situational. Previous seasons, it seemed like he took a lot of inefficient threes - he used to fall in love with the three if he made one and start heatchecking left and right, and he also would take them a lot when he was tired, which isn't great offense for him or the team. This year he's cut out the majority of those bad shots (still taking some heatchecks though, like taking two threes in the first minutes of the game last night) and only shooting when it's truly a good shot, which has helped a ton for his percentages.
And the #1 player on the east finals team would be a bad passer for a change if the nets didnt sign fucking harden
Maybe in 6, but if KD and Harden are healthy next time Sixers have no chance
Brah the sixers started got pulled up 25 lmao
KD didn't even play
Bro this is a bit different to an OT loss lmao

And to be fair Bucks fans were celebrating it much harder than Sixer fans are right now.
If you think starters coming back in after they should be finished for the night vs a bench unit on a run is any indication of anything you can enjoy that thinking

Put it with the "Jared dudley hit a 3 once" trophy
Which hopefully means nothing when playoffs come around and rotations get extra tight.
Good thing you only need 2-3 good bench players in the postseason.
Brought to you by people who probably didn’t watch the game. Nets were basically blown out. The 76ers garbage time unit was just embarrassingly bad
samsab
He IS Brandon Ellis
I mean last year we had Brett Brown so
Fat MVP is back on the menu, boys
When tf was Donovan Mitchell in the mvp race and supposed to be the best player on a team that is gonna have to beat the nets. Higher expectations need to be met with higher quality play
Maybe cause it’s true. Btw gg gonna be fun to see y’all healthy Plus I get to watch all the games so even better
Yeah you could, and people constantly do because its a legitimate concern. Just feels like the Nets have plot armor in many fans heads currently
Nash has said that if it were the playoffs they would play Harden but they are being cautious. So maybe it’s that.
Sixers are unquestionably the underdogs in a Nets matchup, even with homecourt. The notion that they can't be beat is wrong though. There's a difference between being favorites and being unstoppable. They aren't the 96 Bulls.
Just like a regular season game where we played bench units for the first 8 minutes of the 4th doesn’t mean much
> In a game where none of the big 3 played fully.

How many games has that happened? 7? They can't stay healthy. That's their problem.
Yeah I mean you guys did this for half a decade, I think we can handle it
Comical how sad it is.
Tears of joy baby
Tryin' to emulate Embiid
I absolutely will, I mean i feel bad like I can’t even have fun shit talking your team is so bad
Damn why so aggressive
Damm so we are that rent free that's crazy man 😂
Lol worth losing your franchise player so you can be salty towards a non-rival in another conference. That's a low ass bar
Fuck the Nets but for real, nobody in the East stopping them.
Damn 76er fans are some of the saltiest fans I’ve ever seen lol didn’t really notice it until Giannis sat down on the court but fuck it’s hilarious.
Bro if go to bed is ur best comeback to me saying y’all suck and are gonna get shit on then yikes. And I’m not even pressed it’s just u philly fans annoy the shit out of me so I enjoy y’all losing
Nets would have won
I think they will. Only player I wont count out is LBJ but I dont even think they make the finals.
Garbage time? Is that why the Sizers had to put there bench in for the final 5 minutes and nets still nearly won? That's honestly embarassing. Everyone in this sub outside of delusional sxiers fans like you know that the Sixers aren't a realistic threat to the Nets.
No your gonna lose
I guess we will see
it’s as they say, it’s really just about who wants it more
Nah I just hate philly more than the nets. Nets are like
The little brother only we can make fun of while y’all are just that annoying weirdo
Wouldn't need a comeback with the 6 players we were missing, though.
Sorry! I really like watching a bunch of different basketball teams, Philly included!
Lmao so you only counting the first 3 quarters? Also by that logic I can say the rockets beat the warriors in game 7 in the 2018 wcf because I am only gonna count the first two quarters
Game was fairly close until the 3rd quarter. You know what’s gonna happen when Kyrie isn’t able to get buckets, they go to Harden or KD and it’s wraps
He had like 39 on 29 shots, That shouldnt impress you at all lol
ah got it, lobs don't count as assists
No this game meant this nothing. Nets have 2 mvps that’s why they will win the series
Specifically attacking my flair when i'm saying all teams are getting run down by the nets. Yeah it kinda is. You're probably gonna deflect this so i'll let you be now.
They didn’t stop the run at all lol. Hence why they finished with a negative +/- even though they had built up a big lead going into the 4th
Will do. Good luck with the rest of the season, that schedule looks rough.
I don't blame him at all. We grabbed him off the street right before the playoffs. It was a failure of roster construction that our best option was Bregman Roe.
She just got jingled
started so much shit in our sub during BB days, those threads were heated af and funny af too
Some of the best defense I've seen on him was from Schroeder and Kyrie was still hoopin lol. I don't doubt for a second that if Kyrie hadn't been kicked out he would've gone off.
And TLC could've not been there, didn't really add much that run
Embiid has gotten good of getting out of doubles until he's gassed, but he hasn't been gassed too often in the 4th this year fortunately for us. It could change when he's gotta play every game in the playoffs, but he also looked kind of pissed that he had to go back in today too lol
Kyrie's defense was noticeably better when he was the 2nd/3rd option and not the first.
The Harden offense where he dribbles for 15-20 seconds is easy to game plan for. Much better when there is man and ball movement
Going from a 20 point lead to a 3 point lead is definitely considered blowing a lead. Especially when the other team is playing their 3rd stringers on the second night of a back to back against your starters. 

And yeah I was there. Was also there when we beat the Lakers with Lebron by 11.
They traded for him. And if they didn’t trade for him they’d have LeVert, he’s a very good passer in his own right.
We'll do the same in the playoffs and that same bench that came back tonight is gonna pour another 20+ on y'all 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Was actually about to edit my comment and fix that lol
I mean any team is gonna be happy with a win lol I’m pretty sure bucks fans weren’t “celebrating harder” when the other team didn’t have their star player.

Regardless what I said still stands.
This exactly.  This was classic ‘starters thought they were done’ vs. hot bench.  Happens all the time in the regular season and almost never in the playoffs.  Should it have happened, no. Does it give us any info about the playoffs? About as much as a game that KD and Harden don’t play in.
You do realize the starters were only finished because of your bench right? Your bench shot amazingly to get ahead, the shooting was unsustainable, and then you came back down. Doc tried to get starters in to save it, and at the end of the day I’m cool with the results.
put it with the sixers took the raptors to 7 trophy.
Even 10 minutes of Harden + bench unit is gonna be scary for the 76ers,and having depth at the center is gonna help vs Gianiss and Embid
Ya we could of used Dwight off the bench he brings so much energy off the bench
True but you guys have championship hopes this season. It’s going to hurt more if you lose because of coaching this year.
I'm kinda sick of this take. 

Brown coached us exceptionally well in the playoffs vs Toronto when we got bounced by Kawhi. The front office did Brett exactly 0 favors that offseason. Our roster construction was so dogshit that I'm not sure Popovich, Kerr, or Nurse could have fixed it. 

Going into the year after that Toronto series we replaced Jimmy with Jrich and JJ Redick with Al Fucking Horford. Right off the bat we lose not 1 but 2 of our most important offensive options from the previous season, 1 being a ball handler/shot creator and the other being our only reliable volume 3 point shooter who had one of the best 2 man games with Embiid EVER. Shake Milton wasn't a reliable player at that point and we almost cut Furkan because he was actually ass early on. So now instead of having an "ok" offense we have some amalgamate of bigmen 4's and 5's and a single "guard" in J Rich who doesn't even shoot the 3 well enough to make up for everything that offense lacked.

The Brett Brown slander is such revisionist history based on last season, he was a fucking fantastic coach who got fucked over by the front office/ownership.
Could be, jokic’s to lose now though
*bellows emphatically*
the jazz are also contenders and rudy isn't gonna be the one taking all the shots if they make the finals lol
I’m just a doomer, I think the sixers are legit contenders but the nets are just annoyingly stacked, I will root against the nets since I hate super teams so I really hope you guys beat them
Yeah obviously, but they aren't being cautious for fun. They're being cautious because Harden just re-injured his hamstring. It's a real concern.
Yeah obviously, but they aren't being cautious for fun. They're being cautious because Harden just re-injured his hamstring. It's a real concern.
Yeah obviously, but they aren't being cautious for fun. They're being cautious because Harden just re-injured his hamstring. It's a real concern.
This game doesn’t mean shit. You’re not beating the nets
Yeah I see youre branching out, finding hobbies in other threads. Its good to expand your horizons.
Ah okay now you’re deflecting to my flair because you know your team isn’t doing shit to the nets

Also, your team bottomed out for like half a decade, don’t think you’re any better
We were going to lose him anyways. Him shitting on yall is just a plus
We annoy you because you're a soft little boy relying on reddit for life advice
If we suck then how bad are the Knicks?
Bad things happen in Philadelphia.
Yes your not gonna win
Say what you want I dont buy that game coming in to the playoffs
As far as evaluating for playoff matchups yeah. Obviously the Nets bench outplayed our bench in the 4th
They do what I’m saying is he’s not exactly a playmaker for the rest of the team. He a shot creator and an amazing one at that but doesn’t translate to team success. They have KD and Harden so they don’t need him to
mvp is a regular season award, doesn't matter
Sixers won :)
If the starters don’t come in the nets win the game.
One of the lightest strength of schedules actually (Sixers 22nd while Nets are 9th)
He was actually playing for us earlier in the season, as luck would have it
> It could change when he's gotta play every game in the playoffs, but he also looked kind of pissed that he had to go back in today too lol

That's something I'd definitely be worried about after the first round.  Philly probably needs him playing 38 minutes or more each game.
His brace was fucking with him all game it looked like.  That tires him more too.
He's averaging 11 assists per game this season. I used to think he was a Trae Young type player but this year having watched him his assists are his highest value to the nets. Making even deandre jordan look like a shadow of his former self at least.
> blowing a lead

Literally never in the history of sports has this expression been used the team with the lead won the game.  Please explain to me how a lead can possibly be blown IF THEY STILL HAVE THE LEAD? You're just not understanding the words you are using.

Great so how do you reconcile those two results in your brain? If you take the same analysis you came up with from this sixers game and applied it to that game you'd think Lebron was garbage.  Do you get it yet???
Bucks fans acted like the won a playoff series... lol
Can it go next to the nets signed some free agents trophy?
For sure, hoping y’all have a crazy hard path through the second seed tho.
If we think the top three right now is Jokic, Embiid, and Harden, they've all been called out of shape at some point this season
Agreed with your point. People think these injuries are phantom. Hamstring issues are very easy to reaggravate.
And yet here you are, still incredibly salty in a post-game thread of a game that your team didn’t play in for some strange reason. 

What’s it like now that your window has fully closed and you won’t be competitive for another decade?
No deflecting we will beat the nets, I just feel bad. We did but we also didn’t have James Harden and piss it away
I guess that's fine, I just don't know why a rockets fan has such beef with a random team. Always liked the rockets
Ahhh yesss I’m def very sad and crying myself to sleep every night please help Me. And u, some random odude who keeps on replying to the “soft little boy” is def the not the sad one who just sits on his ass and eats ice cream depressed abt his life so much he takes everything so seriously and thinks he can try to insult someone to prove a point. Touch some grass bro it’ll help u out
We boutta go on a 4 game win streak on your ass
*and starters
KD a 2x finals mvp nephew. Nets have the 2 best players in that series
I mean we’ll never know that. But when they came in the run extended to 21-2 and ended as a 25-6 run so I definitely wouldn’t say “they stopped a 16-2 run dead in their tracks.”
Clips, Dubs, Suns, & the Bucks b2b over your next 5 games?
Hey man, fuck you lol (jk)

This should be a lesson to everyone who says X player won’t make a difference or won’t push a team over the edge. Greg Monroe played 2:30 and was a -12 in a game I think we lost by 2-3. If he just made one decent play the entire time he was in the Sixers probably win the game.

Every marginal upgrade matters when the margins are this small.
What a coincidence, he was with us the season before when we knocked out the sixers too haha
Potentially, but hopefully he maintains the energy he's had most of this year, even on b2bs
Lol. Let me break it down for you. 

Tonight. Embiid scored almost 10 points over his average with garbage efficiency. 

In our loss to the Lakers none of our stars scored their average. Kyrie got ejected, KD was on minutes restriction and Harden didn’t play. 

You almost lost tonight against half our team while your team was fully healthy.

If you’ve never heard “blowing a lead” while still winning then you’re probably not much of a sports fan. 

It’s not that hard to understand. I leave feeling pretty good about our odds in a playoff matchup with you guys. Either way best of luck.
I mean they didn’t but okay lol
Hahaha I hadn’t realized that, pretty interesting in an age where athleticism is praised so highly
At least we were competitive. You were only competitive for one season and the only reason you even were is in Miami right now. 

Imagine tanking for 5 seasons and having nothing to show for it
Yeah you just wasted it by drafting a bunch of busts
He’s obsessed with the Sixers after Harden got traded to the Nets. Look at his post history, it’s sad.
Guys listen to his advice, the hes been coping with the Knicks his whole life. He certainly knows sadness
Why you so salty?
They outscored them for 4 minutes, and we didn't play Tobias Harris who is our main perimeter ball handler late in games. Congrats
You told me regular season doesn't matter then used it twice to prove a point. That is just funny.
Then why would say the run stopped when we had absolutely no momentum
4 tough games then look at the rest. Nets play the Bucks twice in a row as well as more tough opponents
Our last 12 games are literally all cake walks
> In our loss to the Lakers none of our stars scored their average.

You're literally the "if you reduce Pat Mahommes' stats to their average he's average" guy.  

>You almost lost tonight against half our team while your team was fully healthy.

So you still don't understand why I brought up your loss to the Lakers do you?

>“blowing a lead”

You didn't say the sixers are "blowing their lead". You clearly said "blown".  It's literally right there bud.  

You're one of the slowest people I've interacted with on reddit.  You have no clue what the words you even use mean.  I hope for your sake english isn't your first language or you're intoxicated.  Legit moron
Just checked the post game thread... my bad, it was Doris Burke who called it a “signature win” and all that bs. 

She hates the Sixers...
If you think you’ll have anything to show for the next 5 years, I have a bridge to sell you lol.
Imagine having 2 players with 10 1st-teams and an MVP between them and having nothing to show for it.

No wonder Chris Paul and Harden wanted out of that dead end franchise.
We're not competitive this season?
Ahh yes the classic busts that are the current MVP favorite and the best defensive player in the league. We definitely missed on a couple but that’s the luck of the draft
You do know they didn’t play kd or harden right? So I don’t know what you are evaluating for the playoffs since most of those guys might not even get playing time in the playoffs
I have no idea what you’re trying to say here...
Yeah it was definitely not a signature win lol in fact it was kind of embarrassing going into OT and barely winning without the other teams star player.
What will the sixers have to show? Losses to Brooklyn?
Uh, we won 65 games and were 3-2 against golden state until Paul got injured. When was the last time Philly was in a conference finals? Don’t you get pounded by a 19 year old every season lol?
Not unless you challenge the nets
Markelle fultz and jahlil okafor?
Yes? And so we will probably not be up by 22 in the 4th nearly as often. You know the Lakers smoked them without LeBron and AD so the Nets will get swept in the Finals
U said bringing the starters back in didn’t make much of a difference and I’m saying that they did
Is baby cranky?
We haven't really had a chance. If we win by a little with just kyrie it apparently doesn't count. If we blow them out with just harden it also apparently doesn't count. So unless they play all 3 starters y'all will say it doesn't count regardless of the outcome.
I literally said we missed on a couple, Okafor for sure but Fultz was the consensus Number One pick. I mean either way I’m pretty happy with how it ended up. I actually have always like the rockets and am hopefully y’all rebuild soon
What does that have to do with what we’re talking about? You said you are evaluating this game for the playoffs but they are missing 6 players.
How? The Nets scored 5 quick points with them in and cut it to 3 points. At that point it just turns into a foul and FT show
Are you?
Agreed, this game was not very good for evaluating. The 5 players the Nets came back with will not be on the floor in the 4th quarter in the playoffs. I do know that we were able to abuse their defense when they had Kyrie, DJ, and Joe Harris on the floor, however I'm of no delusion we're going to be able to stop their big 3
Ok. I’m not going back and forth anymore we can just agree to disagree
More like you have no evidence that bringing them in helped at all. The run still continued and they were the only two guys to finish with a negative +/- for you. We can agree that you’re just wrong
He’ll no. I’ve actually played basketball before so Ik when a team has momentum they don’t just stop for no reason. Ur just an idiot who doesn’t realize the starters slowed the game down and got those fouls for a reason.
LOL you’re such an idiot. They got those fouls because we intentionally fouled like trailing teams do at the end of every game. They didn’t do anything special at all.
Haha down 3 with 2.5 mins to go and u foul. Damn Steve bash must be an absolute dumbass then
A quick look at the play-by-play shows with 2.5 minutes left we actually got a steal by doubling Embiid with Johnson and Claxton. That led to a bucket at the other end. It’s incredible how much you don’t know what you’re talking about
Ok 2 mins exactly then either way, u don’t foul down 3. Ur grasping now since uk I’m right
I’m not grasping at anything lol. Even the quickest of looks at the box score and play-by-play shows that bringing in Embiid and Simmons at the end didn’t stop the run. It’s just sad to see you keep moving the goalposts and denying the obvious truth
I haven’t moved any goalposts. I’m just shocked that u think the sixers bringing in their starters had no effect at the end. I obviously can’t make u see what happened nbd
Obviously you just didn’t see what happened. They continued to get outscored. But I can’t make you leave your fantasy land of make believe where you somehow thought they did well at the end. Stay in denial
Bulls won for Theis have to keep him happy on his Birthday.
Can we never face Certified Nets Killer™ Nikola Vučević ever again please

Prayers up to Tyler Johnson, non-contact injuries are so devestating
Patrick Williams so goddamn good man
Pretty sure that means we’re the best team in the league???? But idk I don’t do math
First home game with the new squad, easier schedule coming up now. Big excited
HELL YEAH BULLS
Satoransky won this game. What a night for him!
Thank you bulls! Very cool
Shoutout to everyone in the pregame thread telling 76ers fans to enjoy the 2nd seed
This team is GOOD when they are clicking
Satoranksy is going on a list 📝

Mf played like Tony Parker today
See what happens when’s we feed the vooch?? Let’s gooooo, big dub for the boys Nets being short handed or not
Happy Vuc finally got a W with the Bulls
GG Bulls. Once you guys get a little more time to gel ya’ll will be dangerous. Cheers!
I love Wendel and I hope that he succeeds for the Magic, becomes an all-star/all-defense whatever. But it is so goddamn refreshing to watch a big man that can score for your team.

Vucevic is so smooth and he isn't even adapted to our playstyle yet. Finally we have something to build upon after years of mediocrity. Maybe this won't pan out as well I don't know, but at least we are excited to watch this team now.
Is Durant alive?
What a game to break a losing streak on! Really good game from everyone all around. Rotations are starting to stabilize, Lavine’s getting healthy, really great defense all around, shout out to Troy Brown, I’m so glad we got him at the deadline. Hopefully Johnson and Shamet are okay, non-contact injuries suck so much.
Sato is one of the most underrated Bulls players
I know they got stats but that Blake/LMA defense...
This loss is *not* Kyrie's fault but man the offense looks like shit when Harden isn't running it for 30+ minutes a game.

Before y'all come at me, yes I understand Kyrie had 15 assists.  He played well, the offense just looks like a lot more stagnant when Kyrie is running it full time.
Yay i have suffered too much pain
Unreal! I put nice chunk of money on the Nets winning, -2.5 spread felt like a steal, I was wrong to doubt the new and improved Bulls!
Bulls commentators are fantastic
I <3 the bulls
Loss is all on Nash. Game was in reach but he keeps TLC in over Aldridge, Blake and Claxton
The Bulls once played a lineup with Lauri Vuc and Theis and it didn’t completely suck and I lost my faith in humanity.
welp we're gonna get killed by the Nets tmrw
Feels damn good.
fucking vucevic
All my homies hate the Nets

- Nikola Vucevic
Nash in the postgame called it an experimental game with the 2 bigs. Also said he didn’t like it, so unlikely we see this again.
Nets are 1-3 without Harden since his trade
Thank you Chicago very cool
thanks bulls bros
Ayyy congrats bulls bros
The Nets lost AND Blake Griffin was playing? Coincidence? I think not.
I mean fuck whatever happens this year - PWill year 2 + Vuc + Zach is the three superstar team I've been waiting for.
Lavine and Who's a bitch is a scary duo
Ty bulls
Are Nets seriously starting LMA over Claxton? What is this mythical thing called defense eh?
Troy Brown instead of Coby White was the difference.  And 30-7 free throws.
I wish all the nets fan a pleasent 2nd seed
Kinda hard to win when harden is gone. KD is gone. Claxton is not being played.

And THE BULLS SHOOT 30 FREE THROWS. While the Nets shoot 7.
Steve Nash is an idiot for not putting in any center for the 4th quarter. This is why Durant needs ti comeback asap, he's big enough to get rebounds consistently
Great win for the bulls, but a lid was on the rim for them at the line. So many missed free throws.
fuck meth curry no :(
Yay great performance thankfully
All it took was to play a scrub team like the Nets!
GG bulls. Griffin and Aldridge as a combo to start may be a bit slow, so Claxton + Griffin / Aldridge could work better. On the other hand, if I were the coach, I would give more minutes to Alize Johnson and reduce TLC's minutes. Just food for thoughts.
Feel sorry for my Knicks tomorrow.   They're supposed to get Durant and Harden back tomorrow's game.
I am happy
Vucci Mane always has it out for us
TBJ just demonstrated that the Wizards are the worst franchise in the NBA right now
Yes...thank you bulls. Keep the nets at 2nd seed.
So are the Bulls pushing for the playoffs?
GG Bulls, I know people will respond to this with "How can you complain with Harden on your team". but 7-30 FT disparity is kinda much refs Jesus.  Every time we got some momentum a Nets player would get mugged under the basket causing a TO and a Bulls basket.

We definitely fouled more but Kyrie deserved around 4-6 FTs I thought, not a whopping zero, he definitely is gonna complain about it post game and he's gonna get like 12 FTs tomorrow vs the Knicks, which will cause Knicks fans to be super angry especially seeing how our last game played out, but oh well.

The Johnson and Shamet injuries hurt more than the loss.
I wish The Brooklyn Nets a very nice 2 seed
I never want to watch the nets offense without kyrie/harden ever again. Jesus christ the beginning of that 2nd quarter was absolute AIDs
Nets need Harden running things to make this a playoff quality offence. Everyone is saying that their big 3 don't need any time together in game before the playoffs but idk with that and them not really practicing something seems off.

Hope Johnson is ok those non contact injuries usually aren't good news.
1 game not full strength whatever
The Nets terrible defense showed this game
Ez
Harden is MVP
but r/nba told me a washed Griffin and Aldridge were too much, that those killers would put the team over the top and that the buyout market is busted....
Kyrie can’t win on his own.
Great seeing Vooch still killing it out there but I would also be fine with him having some off nights to help that draft pick he got us
How does TLC do it? Able to blackmail his coaches and knows enough voodoo to summon the bball gods to wipe his competition in the same game
bulls 2021 nba champs confirmed
Vuccy Mayne!
Need Harden or KD back asap.
I know it’s really not related to the post but where can I find those city edition jerseys? Like the valley suns one, the blue nets jersey etc
I am very excited to see how this team develops. I think they've got great pieces to make a very fun team to watch.
Don’t blame Nash for trying different lineups but this one didn’t work
What's the difference between the Lakers bench and the Nets bench?

&#x200B;

We can win without our stars

&#x200B;

Burned!!!! LMAO

&#x200B;

Edit: Oh shit, I think I have triggered a certain group. It's just clowning, don't be that sensitive yall LOL
I hate Vucevic
[hmmmmmm](https://twitter.com/johnschuhmann/status/1378800597185495042?s=21)

Not so great
[deleted]
Dude was actually getting calls today. Made me wonder if the War on Theis is over or if it’s just a cease-fire..
u/fongos
It would be fun to see whether teams tend to win more when its one of their players birthday
Vucevic and Patty Mills are on the Mt Rushmore of Nets killers
We play again twice at the very end of the season, pretty sure they’re 2 of the last 4 games, please have your seeding secured by then so you can just rest your big 3
Bulls vs Nets first round match up
Fuck what happened to Tyler Johnson? He was one of my favorite heat players for a while
Vucevic is clearly a gem , the Bulls got themselves
You might have them in the first round lol
Should have signed Vucevic before the trade deadline then
He's definitely going to be a star.
Still have to get through the Cavs don’t get carried away
The league is so much better when the bulls are good. I miss the days of Heinrich, Deng, etc
2nd best team in the East, take it or leave it
No it means we're the best in the league since we beat you a couple days ago (loved your announcers btw).
At least the best team in the east
Idk man , that Orlando team beat Suns,  Nets and Clippers , thats like 3 top 3 teams, i say they are the real champs. Im looking at their team tonight vs Denver. Poor guys have 9 injured players, such a shame for a team that would easily go to playoffs without those injuries and Vooch still being there.
Could consider signing Westbrook to strength your squad, dude was beating the Nets this season
Nope, second best team is the Nets without KD.
It’s been a rocky road as of late, but honestly, it’s not that big of a deal!

Things only look up from here on out...
Good signs all around. We put up a fight against good teams like the Jazz, Suns, and Nets. We haven't been able to close well but a lot of it is due to a mixture of injuries, new players, and figuring out rotations. We play like a playoff team, but we have to close like a playoff team too.
I would love to see you guys get to the 8 spot and play the Nets in the first round. Levine and Vuc is a bad matchup for them and if you can take a game or even two I would love it. Get them feeling that New York media early.
Fuck youuuuuu
Nets in 5
Dunno why they wanted Lonzo when they have Lonzo at home.
>What a night 

Dude it's like the middle of the afternoon
Bulls and Sixers unite. Bixers or Sixells
just for today, i am a bulls fan
These new Nets fans are a special breed.
They still are
Still a decent team anyway so yeah be happy yall got your first dub in a while
Me too 😭
GGs. 

I think we can all agree this would have been a much different game with Harden lol.
Adding a post scorer/facilitator helps lavine so much,  I really wanted Wendell to become that guy (and he still very much could) but the timelines just didn’t work out unfortunately
lol
Kyrie had a good game if you only look at the box score but man Kyrie was clunky today. Missing many easy layups and the offense looked way less spread out than it does when Harden plays
The offense with just Kyrie is just okay. It’s much more focused on transition play, quick pace, and a shitload of threes. All of those traits aren’t particularly consistent though.
Not a good take. Did you watch last game ? Did you watch the game against the jazz where kyrie was solo. Kyrie runs the offense pretty well. The difference tonight was we couldn’t hit 3s and kyrie had a tough shooting night
I know the pundits are going to put this one on Kyrie saying they can’t win if the 3rd best is running the show, hopefully this doesn’t damage his mindset too much and turn him into hero ball mode 

But IMHO, the reason they lost has less to do with Kyrie taking the lead and more so with Aldridge and Griffin getting 27 and 23 minutes, and being a -12 and -10 respectively.  

When it was just Durant and/or just Harden, you had Green #3 in minutes per game in the NBA.  You had Brown playing a ton of minutes, and then Claxton getting 25+ minutes

This is important with the Nets switching defense and is especially important tonight because neither Aldridge or Griffin can switch.  

Claxton getting 9 minutes and Jeff Green getting 25 against stretch 5 like Vucevic was just a bad coaching call.  Hopefully Nash watches the tape and remembers why no one wanted Griffin or LMA
I had them at -1. Should never doubt the bulls!
We do have the best in the business. So lucky to listen to them every game. Radio crew is just as stellar.
eh, first game of a back to back. doesn't really matter if the bulls get a W, better to save for tomorrow
It sucked.  Lauri was standing in the corner 2 feet from another Bull.  Neither of them moved for 10 seconds
Yeah but...imagine if you win.
The people downvoting are mad because they can’t stand the fact that Harden is a great player.
Uhhhh
Claxton's conditioning is not all there yet, he's young and coming off some pretty long injuries, Nash has stressed that they want to bring him along slowly.
Aldridge is terrible.  Will cost them the East
And maybe eventually a 3rd seed
Nash’s rotations are so confusing.. I know we have another game tomorrow, but I think he can afford to play Claxton more than 8 minutes
that was working for us to get back in the game. i dont blame him for going 5 out there.
Nash is an idiot, he doesnt even pass to an open teammate /s. Meanwhile exi5234r1 is one of the best playmakers in games history.
Darn .
play-in seems to be the goal, and we're well in the mix for it
[deleted]
The refs are very inconsistent this year.  And predictable as you are alluding to tomorrow
I hope you keep this same energy when all the calls go your way in the playoffs lol
Lol u guys are such kyrie beef riders. He had 15 assists. Harden lost games by himself too. Now kyrie loses by himself its his fault , but when harden loses by himself is ky fault
side effect of playing their best defender 8 minutes.
Hopefully they can recover from a midseason loss that basically means nothing lol
Nash was experimenting with rotations. It clearly wasn’t working
The Nets missing their two top 5 players showed this game.
Doesn't matter how terrible the defense is tbh. The real reason they lost was because harden wasn't leading the team tonight
that's one way of coping
At least the Nets can beat good teams
They'll still beat any team in 5 or 6 games when healthy
Jokic
Tbh Blake looked better than I expected in the first half
Too much for their contracts.
he won on his own last game though?
Harden can miss the next 6 games 💀💀💀
Nets are like 5-1 when either just Harden and Kyrie play, the Lakers depht is ass
We literally won two games before this and I’d definitely say our bench is better.

It was just kinda hard to win this game when the bulls shot 30 free throws and we shot 7.
Hey you're the guy that complains every time some one posts something egregiously Nets-biased on r/nba new, it's kinda ironic that you're as annoying as those guys and now you're calling people out for being sensitive when you get triggered every time someone compliments the Nets role players lol.
You still have time to delete this
Stop it. He lost 1 game without harden. Harden lost by himself too.
Definitely a ceasefire. It's Easter.
god i miss jonas jerebko
Save it for the off-season. That’s a few thousand karma post if you give a shit about that kind of thing, but more importantly itll be solid entertainment for the rest of us for like 10 minutes instead of regular boring offseason stuff.
Those two are joined by Ersan Ilyasova, Enes Kanter, and probably Domantas Sabonis.
“Patty Mills” 

**shudders**
Playoff Nate Robinson?
The Bucks/Nets/Sixers are gonna be within a couple of game of each other during the last 2 weeks of the season, it's inevitable.
The east does run through them
Captain Kirk is exactly what this team needs.
They will accept 2nd best in the East as long as they also get labeled sPOoKy.
I was joking very clearly lol
Vuc said if best post game, they’re a young team and he’s still getting used to playing with everyone. 

If sato could play consistently like that (very unlikely) I’d be in heaven. Curious to see how we sort out the 1 in the near future because I love Coby and believe he can be a solid player, but he looks so lost playing PG
Stick with it
Hopefully it’s all vanilla moving forward.
Bulls would just not let us win. Kept scraping back every time.
We don't want you
nets fan the new lakers fans. who would have seen that coming
we do not care
Nets in 5 my ass lol
Watch out before we get another bulls 09 playoff series
Against the Bucks in the second round.
This made me laugh
Idk man I'm in Europe and it's very much nighttime. I think it checks out.
Ever heard of time zones?
Chiladelphago Sixbulls
Both make me nauseous

Unless you send Embiid for Felicio in which case my stomach feels fine
I would prefer Buxers in this case. Somehow.
I'm still upset about the 2012 playoffs but I'll allow it.
Lol every fanbase has those kinda fans, I've noticed a lot of Lakers, Sixers, and Knicks flairs being pissed some Nets fans have the GALL to be as annoying and stupid as you guys. It happens, and it'll probably be even more prevalent as long as Kyrie, Harden, and KD are on the team, so uhh get used to them.
See you in the playoffs. I’m guessing there’s gonna be a lot of super team talk and crying about big markets then
First dub against a team with a winning record since early February I believe
Nah, not when you have the, IMO, GOAT Nets killer Nikola Vucevic.

The first thing I thought when Vooch to Bulls happened is the Nets haven't faced the Bulls yet this season.

True enough, dude went bonkers again in this game. Lol
Or kd
I think the Bulls just need to embrace being Nets-lite, they have a lot of offensive firepower that just needs to gel and start clicking, forget the defense for now, establish a strong identity for now
I thought he shot the ball probably a bit too much considering he wasn't really "on" at any point in the game from what I recall.  However, I don't really hold that against him without both Harden and KD in the lineup.  Sometimes players of that caliber have to take too many shots to give their team a chance.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
Probably because we didn’t have a lot of rim running this game. Our big centers were barely in. Really feel like this was an experiment game for Nash
Kyrie missed some gimmies but he also would get shoved with zero calls. A Net couldn't buy a FT today. This was also just a wonky ass line up. Both Blake and Aldridge starting, then a bench unit without a consistent distributor or bucket getter was weird.
I was shocked to see him missing bunnies and especially the ones Lauri was protecting the rim
Time to blame the young guys
Yeah, I don't mean to say it's "bad," it's just not very consistent in the halfcourt.  

I think it just comparatively looks a decent bit worse than when Harden is the main creator for most of the game.
Also, two of the three are out, it's one of the those games where you get to experiment with lineups and stuff
I mean I'm very far from a Harden fan, but those people are idiots lol
KD hasn't played in these games, right? And the trade assets didn't play either. That doesn't tell the full story but it makes sense.
Gonna fall to the 4-seed so we can play in the 2nd round, big brain strats.
I'm gonna be a dick and chime in that Nets fans were very upset with me when I noted how many minutes LMA got out of the gate over Claxton. 

Hopefully he figures it out and gets Claxton more reps.

Edit: not that it's like an irreparable issue but it's something to keep an eye on.
I hope you get there.
It's the east have some faith will ya
Yea it’s a vicious cycle and why getting fouls is such a valuable skill in the NBA. It is what it is, and the Nets have for sure gotten the advantage numerous nights especially with our personnel, but man the gap today was quite noticeable.
So are top tier rookie's....it doesn't break the NBA.
So my comment still stands is what you are saying?
The irony is lost on this one
Harden lost to a healthy Sixers and Mavs team by himself. Kyrie lost to the bulls. There’s a big difference there
Mike Dunleavy Jr is the OG
Tell me more about Ersans history against the nets? Curious since he’s still a recent addition to our team.
Collin Sexton
Cant forget Danny Ainge
Sounds like Eastern Europeans just don’t like the  nets
Sixers by .5 with the Bucks down by 2 in 3rd place.
But these next few years are Beverley's. Checkmate Cavtheists.
He would be feasting with Vooch and LaVine. This man was out here getting use outta Tyrus Thomas.
Knicks Bulls and uninjured Hornets may all have the spooky titles.
Well me too in first part at least lol
Yea I think it’s highly unlikely that Sato shoots 80% from the field and 66% from 3 while averaging 11 assists per game for the rest of the season. Just teasing but a more consistent Sato would help you a lot for sure.
People keep saying the Bulls are a young team and in past years this was true, but at this point they're probably close to the middle of the league in terms of average age. Their recent draft picks are still very young, but LaVine is 26, Sato is 29, Vuc is 30, and Thad is 32.
maybe yall could get brogdon from indiana? brogdon/lavine/williams/young/vucevic is scaaary
The nets fans are faker too, which is really saying something
Clippers fan 😂.
Lol I'm pretty sure the bulls aren't making the playoffs
Aganist any eastern conference team
oh and we're supposed to just trust anything you say? we already know you're lying because only americans watch the nba
Yup, it's midnight here as well
Is your time zone 17 hours behind?
The city of brotherly wind.
Sixbulls has a certain, biblical ring to it.

Lo, the harbinger of the end riding on a sixbull.
Chiladelphago is definitely being included in my dnd campaign lmao pure gold
Chill chill chiladelphia
One Zach Lavine for Furkan Korkmaz pls
The only Nets fans that actually annoy me are the ones that try to act like this organization is like the best run in the NBA and that's why they got Kd and Kyrie. That goes the same for Miami fans, Lakers fans and Clipper fans. Like yes your front office did a nice job but if you weren't in New York you'd be the Pacers. It's ok to acknowledge built in advantages and people pointing them out aren't criticisms, and it doesn't make rings less meaningful.
You're gonna have to get used to these comments too man. Any time you say anything about your team it'll be "lol Nets fans" just cuz your team is great and you have tons of fans, some of which are obnoxious. It's just another way for people to feel good about *their* camp
[deleted]
Well we will probably be a combination of the 1 and 2 seeds. Not sure y'all will make it to the ECF to face us tho :)
That's a given.

I mentioned Harden b/c of the FT discrepancy mainly
Or without ky
Yeah, 7 to 38? Is this a record of some sort? The discrepancy between two teams
1 loss. When kyrie is without harden and we ready to hate on him. Wow thats crazy
KD played in 1 of the games which was a loss against Washington (the choke job when Harris through a bad inbound for a Westbrook 3). That was the only game KD played without Harden since the trade
my guess is that Aldridge is gonna sit out tomorrow and Clax will get a lot of minutes. But still.. he could have played at least 20 mins today
Wish it would go back to the 70s where offensive players are never given calls when initiating contact into a players chest.   Now it becomes a game is who is more of a superstar in the collision.  Rookie against Dame....ya Dame run that mother over....foul on the rookie.  Drawing fouls should not be a skill that can be exploited unless the defender is out of position.   Watched the Bulls game today. Saw two traveling violations get called.  I loved it.  But if that was Lebron or Harden that call is never made.
Not it doesn't the Lakers depht is wack
Lol not really, you're just as annoying as those posts in new, and you seem conscience enough to realize why it's annoying, and yet... Here you are.
Dude is just responding with paragraphs to comments. This loss to the Bulls hurt him bad
U act like the bulls suck. They have a great big man in vouch and fucking zack lavine
Fuck Mike Dunleavy
FMD
The number of times he put up a [20+ point and 15-25 rebound double-double games](https://www.netsdaily.com/2017/12/4/16733022/is-ersan-ilyasova-the-biggest-net-killer-on-the-hawks-or-it-someone-else) against us...I'm pretty sure this is at least some sort of felony out there in NetsWorld
Man turned his sliders all the way up. When him and Zaza were in Milwaukee together, they had some absurd rebounding numbers against the Nets and they were usually the only bigs for the Bucks
Any combination seems likely, Bucks have been rolling lately I can see them in that first seed. I think we’re all also sleeping on the Heat a bit. All 3 of our fan bases wants that 1st seed to avoid each other until the ECFs but the Heat in the 2nd round won’t just roll over, and Spo is the best coach out of our 4 teams so that’s a problem.
You’re right who are we kidding, he could shoot 90%, average 15 assists and 20 points a game /s 

If he can just play his part and facilitate the offense so we can get Vuc on a mismatch or lavine a solid look I’d be happy. Until we can find a truly solid 1 that is because I think that’s our biggest hole at the moment. Other than struggling to close out close games
I can understand what you mean and you have a point we definitely are average age wise by now. But that’s still relatively young, and I consider it a young team only because we’ve been hoping our recent draft picks (PWill, Coby, Lauri) will pan out, Lavine is 26 which is still young.

In my view were young not just by age alone but chemistry wise as well. New coach, tons of hope in recent picks with one guy just entering his true prime(Lavine) and another who is in the midst of his (Vuc). Couple years I hope from being a true championship contender if everything pans out. By then Vuc will be 33-35, Lavine not even 30 and PWill/Coby around 24. 

So I guess by young I meant inexperienced in some ways.
I’m not sure what we could offer them that they’d accept, I don’t see them wanting Lauri and or Coby, plus I’m not sure what our picks look like off the top of my head. But someone of that caliber would make us a solid playoff team in my opinion.
Is it really that scary though?
Depends
this is embarrassing
We're 5 games behind the 4th seed. I think the bulls have a shot especially with their next 11 games
No
Imagine a shirtless Thybulle riding in on that sixbull among claps of thunder and bolts of lightning
AI Jordan Barkley MVP Rose and 2023 post enlightenment Embiid.
Both are dunk contest champions. Sounds fair to me.
Deal, you give us Embiid for Felicio, and we’ll give you Archi for Ben Simmons
That’s fair, but I think some Nets fan are claiming that because a lot of other fans are completely dismissing what Sean Marks has done, and he’s basically our God. Like if you told Nets fans in 2016 we’d be akin to the Pacer in a few years we’d be over the moon, we were supposed to be in the basement for years. It’d be like saying Masai got lucky Kawhi hated the Spurs and Pop hated the Lakers, sure he did a solid job making a juggernaut regular season team but the Raptors ring was “lucky”. But that’s the thing, there’s so much luck involved in sports. It’s easy to tell when an organization is poorly run, but how do we differentiate the top. There’s so many unknowns and risks involved in every draft, FA acquisition, everything.

Either way I hope to God that Brooklyn somehow even touches that tier of Miami/LA for free agents, that would be amazing.
We just want Sean Marks to get the credit he deserves.
Nets FO was a shit show before Sean Marks took over.

Longtime Nets fans are just stating the fact that since Marks took over, this Nets team has become one of the most well-run organizations.

To be honest, the glaring advantage this team had is Kyrie grew up to be a Nets fan. He wanted to come home and play for this team and KD wanted to play with him.
By the same token, you *have* to respect the objectively great job the Brooklyn FO has done. Sure, they benefit from a big market, but they're not the Knicks or the Bulls. Clearly they've done something right to build an organization that stars consider worth joining, unlike other franchises in comparable markets.
100% the location helped us get these stars. 

But we're still one of the best run orgs in the league right now and it's asinine to think otherwise. Marks built a 6th seed out of the worst team in the league with no FRP control. Location didn't mean anything then when our only options were late firsts (drafted Caris & JA) and guys like Spencer and Joey, who were on their way out of the league.
[deleted]
It's actually run well with Marks and Tsai.
Same fans chastising us for signing Jrue for such a big contract. The number of times I saw "He's making more than Booker or McCollum, why sign him to that much".

Like why didn't the Bucks FO think of that, why not just go sign another all star with all this money? Just pick one and do it, it's not hard.
"Calm yourself"
"Not sure y'all will make it to the ECF to face us tho"

I can say the same thing to the Sixers too, no?
7 to 30, I doubt it's a record or anything, refs have been terrible and inconsistent for a long long time, but man this one was rough. Hopefully the refs will be in our favor tomorrow.
Making an observation isn't "hating" on Kyrie.

Jesus christ.
This is a crazy unfounded idea but I wonder if Nash has biases from his playing days. Like he saw what LMA could do in Portland and he still has that image of him.
I think a superstar bias has existed forever across all sports, it's kinda why having a superstar is so important, like not only are they supremely talented but they get the calls to boot (obviously some stars don't). I'm feel like the average fan enjoys high paced high scoring offenses more than hard nosed physical defense (this is across all sports as well), so the rules will further and further benefit the offense and limit defenses as time goes by.
But you just said Harden or Kyrie........You know what, nvm
You sound hurt by my comment, literally it's just a comment lol
They suck  compared to the sixers and mavs that’s a fact if you check the records. If this was a top team then it’s nbd but it’s 10th seeded 20-28 bulls were talking about lmao Harden wouldn’t have dropped this game
Nah mike was always solid his whole career and hit big shots when needed later on
He is an innocent man, attack his son
Fuck zaza pachulia
And yet we have had injuries, yall had injuries, yall surged, the Bucks surged and the standings still look pretty much exactly the same. Inelastic standings. You can't beat fate.
> we definitely are average age wise by now. But that’s still relatively young

. . . what?

> Lavine is 26 which is still young

26 is literally the average age in the NBA this year, and LaVine is in his 7th season.
Lakers fans at least existed even when they were bad. The Nets flairs popping up left and right are obvious bandwagons, who will disappear like Warriors fans once the superteam disbands.
5 games is a LOT
8==================D
Arci is untouchable
My point is just that teams that are in New York, Miami and LA don't have to rely on luck as much as other teams. I look at the Raps right now, our literal only hope of winning a championship is getting a star in the draft. The Nets can be a 6-8 seed with no stars and have some degree of hope because they are in New York. To teams in LA, Miami and New York being a 6-8 seed without a star is a stepping off point to greater things, for everyone else unless with your 17th pick you get an all star you're just stuck there most likely. It's not impossible but it's definitely most challenging. I just got annoyed with Nets fans acting like they had the best front office in the league and everyone else could have gotten them if they had a better front office which is obviously bullshit.
I hear ya man and he's done a phenomenal job and deserves lots of credit. Just want people to realize that they had a unique opportunity partly due to their location and that there are lots of great front offices who don't have those opportunities. To get free superstars in free agency you need to be both well run and an attractive location. Nets are both of those but lots of teams just have 1 of those 2.
Yeah of course just that if Utah or Indiana or any number of other teams had done the same they wouldn't have gotten them. It's not like it's just automatic be in New York and get stars but every Lamarcus Aldridge is the only star free agent that didn't go to a free agent destination in the last decade.
Well of course just that if you aren't in Miami, New York or LA chances are you are still that 6 seed. Nobody cares that Indiana went from one playoff roster to an entirely different one and made nice moves because where did it get them?
Yes but lots of teams have good FO. The bet FO in the league are teams that typically don't get free agents. Utah or Indiana or Toronto could do what the Nets did and they'd still be the 6th seed hoping to get lucky late draft picks.
Yeah, Bucks Heat ECF
It's loss and ur ready to condemn that man
Aldridge was almost certainly promised minutes by the Nets.
I appreciate both.   I don’t want to see two terrible teams slug it out but the Pistons beating Shaq for the title was amazing.  Watching tashaun, rip, and sheed neutralize top 20 of all time players without the refs taking it away from them was great.  And that is coming from a Bulls fan.
One of either Harden or Kyrie= whatever consists of the Lakers depht. The Nets gave up all their depht for an extra star which is essentially a substitute.
You don’t understand 

Fuck Mike Dunleavy
Death.  Taxes.  Nets 0.5 games behind the Sixers.
Notice how I said the 4th seed. The bulls are the 10th seed rn. They, at worst, will get into the play-in and have a very good chance at winning.
Arci is from Philly send him home
So far with the Clippers and Nets getting big FA acquisitions has been an one time thing more than a rule, let’s see if this trend continues. Also those teams had to be fringe playoffs teams while still having cap space for 2 max deals that coming off season and assets attractive to stars, which... is pretty tough.

But yea being in the middle ground in sports has always been the worst, there’s no easy fix without a lotta luck.
The point was we were being run by an elite front office with an elite culture so being the well run NY team thanks to Sean Marks players would love to join that atmosphere. We were right, and people laughed at us. 

ThE mECcA
Like yeah being in NY is why we aren’t the Pacers. But our Front office is why we also aren’t the knicks
Of course. I agree with you, it just bothers me when people say things like "Nets just got lucky by getting 2 stars" while not even acknowledging the foundation that Marks built in such a short amount of time with VERY limited assets
Both sides of the argument are valid. Yes, without the lure of NY the Nets probably don't break into this top contender tier anytime soon as we've seen many times with well-run franchises that are not as locationally blessed.

But then the talk swings too far and dumb fans act like Marks building what he did with the handicap he started with isn't impressive on its own. Everyone was talking about how with the Nets assets and situation after Billy King's disastrous job that it would twice as long to even become a half-respectable franchise. If the Nets don't become a respectable franchise by 2019 then none of this happens in Brooklyn either so we're gonna lash back at the people talking shit about Marks like he just got lucky too.
Indiana has never been in as poor of a spot that we were in 5 years. Like... no team in the history of the sport has been in that bad of a situation since the Stepien Rule. You understand this, yea? Having no first round picks and being the worst record in the league isn't something that happens often.
5 years ago the Nets biggest signing was Jeremy Lin and Spencer Dinwiddie

10 years ago they were trying to shed Travis Outlaw, Anthony Morrow, Sasha Vujacic, and Johan Petro

they just happened to strike lightning at all the right angles and finally are putting it together
Sean Marks inherited the worst situation. We were supposed to be the process level 76ers without the picks
I've thought the same thing the entire year - even in games where Harden does play.  Kyrie doesn't run an offense nearly as well as Kyrie does.

That doesn't mean Kyrie isn't great.  

Understand that there's usually some nuance to an opinion.
So are you saying you need Harden, Kyrie, LMA, and Blake to beat the bulls? Got it
Lol why
The Hawks and Knicks are better
It's not a one off when the only teams other than San Antonio with Lamarcus Aldridge to get a star free agent over the last decade have been LA, New York and Miami with the exception of Lebron in Cleveland for very specific reasons. It's new in terms of those franchises being well run when they weren't in the past but the location is still the thing. If the Nets were in about 20-25 other cities they don't get them that's the point. They did a good job but some Nets fans act like it's some special front office and every other one just wasn't good enough otherwise they would have gotten them.
Well yeah but I just think the way some fans brag about the "culture" as if they're had like the best culture in thr NBA and other teams don't get these players because they don't have the culture is just annoying when teams like Denver and Utah could have the greatest culture in the NBA and not get anybody.
Yeah it's definitely not luck I don't think it's ever fair to call it luck when you're acquiring players. I think there can be luck involved like all the circumstances that allowed Durant to go to the Warriors but that's never the explicit reason. It's not luck that the Dodgers and Yankees are always good, they're fortunate to have huge budgets in prime locations but you need so much more than that.
It's absolutely impressive what Marks did and I don't think acquring star players is ever luck. I think there's the odd occasion like Lebron to the Lakers or Lebron to Cleveland where the team didn't have a whole lot to do with it but the Knicks show that you need to be both well run and a destination you need to be both and Marks tranformed the Nets into a well run team that was also in NY.
I mean again that literally has nothing to do with what I said. Beinf Indiana has nothing to do with how bad they were before my point is that they'd be a 4 seed at best with basically no chance of winning a championship. My whole point is about the Nets fans that think it was just the culture and if other teams had the same culture they could have gotten. You are clearly not one of thosr people. Nets fans are certainly not the only ones I've run into Miami fans that are the same way. Lakers fans are like Yankees fans though they totally acknowledge the advantage but are just bigger assholes about it.
If the Nets were in Indiana do they sign them? If they were in Utah do they sign them? If they were in Minnesota do they sign them? The answer is obviously no. To get superstars of that caliber in free agency you have to be both well run and an attractive destination. Lots of teams are well run, only a few are in attractive destinations. Every major free agent that has either forced their way to another team or left in free agency in the past decade have gone to LA, New York or Miami other than Aldridge and Lebron but Lebron is an exception.
Ok and then he made some nice moves literally nobody is denying that Sean Marks did a great job. The point is that doing a great job for most of the league doesn't result in superstars. And again it's not a criticism it's just the reality.
Ur right. That man is just score. He's a real shooting guard
Just Harden wouldve been enough. Kyrie struggled tonight and Aldrige and Griffin barely played in the second half. Point being the Nets depht is still far superior to the Lakers depht.
coz you just Dunleavy'm open for threeeeee
Certified, Grade A douchebag on the court. Bucks fans hate him cause he was mean to giannis one game. Funny cause Dunleavy logged at least a couple of seasons with the bucks too, he left for CHI the offseason giannis was drafted iirc
Dirty ass MF’er
Punched a bucks player (forget who, but not an exaggeration, actually punched the dude and no foul called) so giannis absolutely decked him later in the game
It kinda is an one off if it literally happened once throughout their histories... obviously I’m hoping it’s not, but I’m not sure how confident I am about the Nets signing two superstars if we have a mediocre roster 10 years from now.


Also how many big FA signing have there been in the last decade, feel like most stars are traded not outright signed.

Kyrie to the Nets and Kawhi to the Clippers is a similar situation to the LeBron Cavs one. They wanted to go home. Furthermore Kyrie grew up a Nets fan. It seems like where you grew up is a pretty big factor. I can see RJ Barrett considering the Raptors in FA for that reason.

Location is obviously a thing, but people acting like it’s the only thing is a tad overboard.

On a side note it seems like smaller markets for one reason or another don’t even try to be in the running. Only ones who went for Kyrie and KD were the Nets and Knicks. The LeBron sweepstakes were between mainly the Lakers and Sixers.
Yes but that’s not the point. Other fan bases laughed at us for saying our culture made us a free agent destination. Everybody knew we were in NY at the time but labeled us as the irrelevant Nets and the knicks would get everybody even though all signs pointed to that making no sense
We told everybody our culture would put us over the top and land us free agents. That’s why we were laughed at
Yeah, so you see why some Nets fans are always arguing for one thing, because they're responding to the dumb fans acting like he did nothing, even though you have a reasonable take on what happened and how the team got where it did. But yeah, NY teams, LA teams, and Miami definitely have a huuuuuge boost in drawing stars if run properly and scarily all of those teams have been doing really well lately (might be a bit early on the Knicks but they're definitely trending in the right direction).
you his cousin or somethiing? being not as good as the best offensive playmaker in the league except maybe lebron is not a knock on your guy.
Why do you keep spelling depth as “depht”?
You proved his point
he had that Bruce Bowen-esque foul in the 2014 or 2015 playoffs when Chicago played Milwaukee
Kawhi to Clippers, PG forced his way to the Clippers, Melo to the Knicks, Butler to Miami, the original big 3 to Miami, Kyrie and Durant to the Nets. Not to mention other teams almost always won't trade for top players because they know they can't retain them. The Lakers can trade for AD because they know he'll stay when Portland can't. Again the only question that matters is if the Nets were in Milwaukee or Utah or Indiana or Minnesota would they get them and the answer is obviously no.
Ok but what does that have to do with my point? Are you saying if you weren't in New York you still would have gotten them?
Yeah there's just the occasional Nets fan that's like hey we have a god tier front office maybe if other teams did too they'd get them and I'm like cmon man you gotta realize it's not that simple. Like Utah turned their team into one of the best from a 13th pick, 27th pick, some random Australian guy and filled out the roster well. That's how most teams that don't tank have to do it.
Because I don't care enough to correct it
Yeah I remember being indifferent about him and then he did a couple things that looked really dirty.
Game 6.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPSUbU1Zs2s
Dunleavy tapped MCJ in the Jaw. and then pushed Giannis. And Giannis leveled him.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWajqr55HFg
Like I said before a lot of those moves are moves to go play at home, which is a whole other discussion. If the Nets were in one of those places and if Kyrie was from one of those places I think we'd have a good shot at getting them. Also the Lakers are on a whole other level, not only is it LA, but they have the name value and rings, it's almost too much.
No. But nobody denies that. I been saying the point was our culture would put us over the top being in NY and we were right but laughed at anyway. None of us believe our culture is the only reason we signed them. I said before without NY we prob would be the pacers (although Kyrie prob would have joined the NJ Nets since he was a big fan but that’s a very unique circumstance) you’re right but nobody thinks that
NY was always factored in to why our culture would make us a premier team to attract free agents. Still nobody took it seriously
Congratulations
But you realize it can't be an actual strategy to hope that a star is from your town and hits free agency when you have cap space and are a good enough team at the right time for them to come right? If Kyrie was from Utah you still think he goes there and Durant follows him?
But that's literally what my original comment was all about, the only Nets fans that annoy me are the ones that do think that and I've run into them a few times on here.
Yea I kinda do. If Utah had the cap space, was well run, had good pieces, and the whole shebang I think Kyrie would of gone there. Well maybe not Utah because of race issues (which is why there's not a lot of basketball players from Utah), but definitely a place like Atlanta or Chicago or Washington. Granted that's another advantage the tri-state area and California have, since the population is massive. I'm pretty sure a ton of NBA players are from both those areas, especially California.

It isn't the best strategy to use home town appeal and sentimentality to attract stars, but it is an option. Like wasn't the Raptors plan last off-season to try and lure Giannis there because of the Masai connection haha?
I think it’s largely a misunderstanding of them trying to say that it’s more then being in NY from people laughing about our culture mattering
Trust me I know what they're saying I can tell the difference I've run into Heat fans that are the same way.
**BAME TIME**
Look, Kyrie just shot again
Kyrie missed every single shot the last 2 minutes lmao
https://streamable.com/s0xi32
Thank You Bam, Very Cool
Holy shit. This was definitely the best win of the season so far. No Jimmy and bam was aggressive as shit. Also we played team ball. 

Good game to the nets.
Suddenly I don’t need to drink
pathetic from Kyrie down the stretch to 'take over' with dogshit shot selection while other guys were hot
I’m so glad we have Butler to motivate this team and the players that won’t throw a hissy fit for being called soft and actually respond
**HOLY SHIT, I'M GONNA CUM**
BAM
maybe shamet shouldve gotten some shots in the last few minutes when he was cooking the heat all game
why does Bam Adebayo turn into god against us
He just took over both sides of the floor down the stretch.
BAM BAM
Heat are officially no longer soft until the next game.
Kyrie just ruined Shamet's best game ever smh
Man landry had 30 at least let him touch the ball on one of the last 5 possessions lol
wtf was kyrie doing
GAAAAHD BAAAMMM
nothin like the crowd reactions after a game winner
I don't enjoy watching the Nets play basketball. They are my least favorite NBA team.

When they lose, I think to myself "yes".

When they beat another team, I think to myself "no".
I’m pretty sure in 3 games against the Nets, Bam has made 5 buzzer beaters including at least 2 3s
Thank you Heat
Harden is the real MVP of this team. Without him theyre dogshit
NO OT TONIGHT
Jesus kyrie lost that game. Other guys were hot but he just kept shooting and missing everything
Man Tyler Herro looked so bad. I only watched the last quarter, but everytime he got the ball their offense just died.
It feels like the Nets is the team that's primed and ready for a huge upset in the playoffs.
Bam with the full-range answer to Jimmy on a mid-range dagger.
Unless your name is KD, you have no business going iso vs Bam and Iggy back to back to close out a game.

Wtf was Kyrie doing
**BAM IS YOUR FUCKING DADDY**

LETS FUCKING GOOOOO WE NEEDED THIS ONE
Kyrie blew it down the stretch
Kyrie going to take some more time off after this
Can’t blame Kyrie, must have thought he was in Boston facing the Bucks again
Lose against the worst rated team in the league, win next game against the eastern conf leaders and league villains without our best player. This team makes no sense.
"This is your best shot-maker" - Kyrie in the mirror probably
Brooklyn sold.
kyrie with that bucks series flashback
Bam is a special player
Nets just missed everything in the clutch lol.
lets gooooo
[Me @ the Nets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwBS6QGsH_4)
even when he plays a few minutes, Kevin Durant is still a stone cold killer. Imagine him with LeBron’s/Harden/Stocktons durability...
Kyrie Irving signature meltdown, including throwing teammates under the bus publicly in 5......4......3.....
lmao cant wait for kyrie to ice out harden or KD in the playoffs
Lol the Nets are almost beating playoff teams in the East with fucking Kevin Durant and James Harden not playing a bit.

Lakers doing the same out West. Man Nash and Vogel deserves so much credit.
Always loved the heat
We now go to Emeril Lagasse for the post-game summary:
bust’n makes me feel good
How soft was that, Jimmy?
EC champs for a reason baby stop schleepin 😤😤😤😤
I WAS LIKE WTF IS HE DOIN BUT AYEEEEE
Kyrie just shot again in the 4th
*BAME TIME*
BAM!!!
The last 3 min of the game had barely any stoppages, it was great to see.
Shamet had the game of his life for nothing
Our best player, Landry Shamet, went off and we lost smh
Everybody knew that shit was going in as soon as the Nets missed.  


Kyrie sold, if your shot is not falling you have to another ways to score. This team is missing James
that loss was frustrating as hell.. Shamet and Joe were cooking and then we gave the ball to Kyrie and he blew it with his poor decision making late in the game. Wasted a career high night for Shamet..
Sorry for all the bad things I've said about you Miami
Why’d KD play only 4 min?
Oh my lanta edrice.
Bucks series Kyrie with an appearance
Kyrie ruining Shamet's game smh my head
Nets should’ve called timeout earlier, not after you let the Heat tie the game. Even worse after the timeout another Kyrie iso when he was having an off game.
Damn kyrieeeee
You live by the Kyrie chuck you die by the kyrie chuck
Bucks series Kyrie played this game down the stretch while he turned into 2016 Finals Game 7 version of himself against us smh

Anyway. Great game and good win for the Heat. Way to respond from the previous loss
1 bad game where he isn't clutch and now kyrie is unreliable. U know he kobe mamba mentality, he's taking that shit miss or make
I’m starting to think Brooklyn is Bams favorite team to play against
I'm just coming here to drink nets fan tears.
Kryie ruined Shamet's night SMH
This is the same Heat team that rolled over for Denver and Phoenix..................
Some games we really live and die by Dragic's performance.

Nice to see Dedmon contributing, getting into the swing of things. 5 offensive boards in 15 minutes is not bad
I wonder if we can actually get 40 before 20.
My boys sent a message. I like it 🔥🔥🔥
MY WALUIGI LOOKING ASSED SON HEARD ALL YALL TALKING SHIT
Kyrie is going to take a few more personal days after that
Kyrie forgot to sage the Heat court and it shows. /s
Knicks fans are pissed the Nets lost this one.
kyrie certainly let nets down late…
People in this sub seriously think Kyrie is better than Dame.
What a choke
Kyrie as #1 option. Yikes.
LETA GOOOOOO
GODDAMN BAM
Who has the Stan Marsh image of him on his computer on deck.  That's how I am after this smexy shot.
Heat coming for that sixth seed
BAM
BAM SO CLUTCH
Ladies and gentlemen I introduce to you trap lines
If I'm a MIA fan I'd be happy that we won, but also pretty worried that we only beat BKN by 2 when they essentially played without KD or Harden, and Kyrie played like utter garbage.
why did kd play 4 mins lol
🅱️AME TIME
*ducks*
kyrie was lost today lol
bucks series flashback
Worst game I’ve seen him play in a hot minute, missed his last 4 shots lol
and Bam was guarding him for a few of those
3 straight Kyrie ISOs. That’s not championship level offense. Even if they were fully healthy, it woulda been KD ISO, Kyrie ISO and Harden ISO

I keep telling people the Nets are gonna get exposed in the playoffs
Bro I thought that lost shot was a foul ngl thank god they did not call it
The Nets as a whole were 0/5 in the final 4 minutes. The last three were Kyrie shots
He's a great player, but at times man he can shoot you out of games
He was forced into playing Hero ball and the heat were able to rebound his forced shots.
Locked down by Adebayo
He was just throwing up shot after shot; hopefully KD and Harden return quickly
He’s no Landry shamet
He's going to need another personal day
Catch up fool, I'm two shots in after that game winner
Bruh really took 3 iso's instead of letting Shamet get a shot who was hot
6/19 from the floor. Meanwhile Shamet was great and didn't get another chance to shoot in the final 4 minutes
Shades of Boston series
Bam absolutely clamped him
Standard Kyrie "leadership" behavior tbh.
Yeah played greedy af towards the end, Shamet was shooting amazingly and didn’t even get a touch
Shh you don't want to hurt his feelings
Par the course for a Kyrie-led team
Yeah but to be far the mega super team wasn't 100%
@Timberwolves
hell yea
Really hope your guys' core sticks together for years to come. Genuinely a hard team to root against at this point.
God dammit Brooklyn you fucks
Not soft
I BAMMED
My pickle has certainly been tickled.
damn dude you could just feel that was gonna go in
BAM
Yeah Kyrie should trust his teammates
Because he's a god
Nope that's just Bam.
Why wouldn't he? Least surprising type of player to dominate the Nets
Because y’all starting center is Blake Griffin
To be fair no Butler means he’s gotta be taking more shots in his absence.
"turn into" like he isnt always one smh
Look at your frontcourt defense to get your answer fam
You mean how every above average big men turn into Tim Duncan against the Nets?
Bruh every center is a God against you
Because your big men are the corpses of deandre jordan and blake griffin.
Lose to the timberwolves - heat not going to make the playoffs  
Win against the nets - heat are the sp00kiest team in the league
This also means that by transitive property Wolves > Nets, at least for now
do people still comment this
what is this, 2014.?
average r/NBA fan
LeMickey fanboy spotted. Your franchise is trying to win and is still almost worse than Okc 😂
If Durant played Brooklyn likely wins by 10 or more. Weird take.
Too much sex
I honestly can’t figure them out. They play well regardless of who they have, but are they going to be the first team to win a championship without their top 3 players ever playing together enough to gel during the regular season?
It makes a lot of sense we had Dwyane Dedmon.
Nah, he's gonna take a day off.
That’s a spicy meatball
thigh contusion
got hurt
Can’t remember the last time he’s been reliable... 2016 with LBJ was the last time no one doubted him...
LeBron and Curry: Been there
He is definitely more accomplished
It’s hard to say for sure who is better, they are both amazing players, but I’d take dame on my team 10/10 because of his consistency and attitude
One bad game and haters come out
We didn’t have Butler, Dipo, Haslem.
6/19 from the floor, 2/9 from 3. He was 2/10 from the floor in the 2nd half
There was a play where Kyrie and Bruce Brown were both guarding Bam in the post. Kyrie waved off Brown so he could guard Bam 1 on 1. They immediately have to double and Bam just kicks it out for an easy 3 for Duncan 🤦‍♂️
Captain Dribbles emerges from the darkness
>KD ISO, Kyrie ISO and Harden ISO

This will work. Nonstop Kyrie ISO won't.
Harden is the key to them winning. He is the best ISO player in the game and his ISO play is one of the most efficient plays overall. He makes the ball move to the right spots when it's needed.

Without him, Nets bench and role players get weaker. As good as KD and Kyrie are, they don't improve their teammates nearly as much.
Calling it now they're losing to the 76ers in 6 games. They're getting abused by teams with good defense, and defense gets way more tight in the playoffs. Harden gonna be doubled all game, KD will have to be cautious from his accumulated injuries+last playoffs where he went down. Problem with pure offensive teams is your shots have to fall all series long for multiple series in a row. That might go better for them because they have 3 of the best ISO scorers of all time but when you score 115 and give up 120 and inevitably one or two of those guys will get tired and their shots will stop falling for several games in the playoffs against teams that can scheme against them.
James Harden would never (no seriously, he wouldn't)
!remindme 2 months
!remindme 3 months
Nah, Kyrie shot them out of the game. Nets were on a run and Kyrie fucked up the flow with ISOs.
someone check to see if any of his family members have birthdays coming up
that was literally the worst he’s done all year
Kyrie hasn’t been playing too much unsuccessful hero ball this year. Him and Harden have both been very clutch for us in the 4th this year. Durant too when healthy
Except for when he dropped 40 on your team and hit the dagger 2 weeks ago. Forgot already?
East gonna have rock paper scissors for seeds 4-9
This 4-7 seed race just got very interesting. And somehow Atlanta is gonna end up being the one in the play in, calling it
Teehee
BAM
Math checks out
same thing tbh
Calling bam an “average big man” is just beyond disrespectful... he averages 20/10/5 while being an all nba defender who locked the shit outta kyrie lol
Is beating the Nets with essentially just one of their Big 3 (their worst one) really an accomplishment?
"yes"
Yeah, check this out.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/mtmdj7/post_game_thread_the_miami_heat_2928_defeat_the/gv0iczz/
yes
Lebron is coming back soon?
Yeah we’re gonna win the championship with our stacked lineup of deron Williams, joe Johnson, Paul pierce, KG and brook
hahahahaha are you really trying to get a dig in on a Cleveland sports team being bad?  I'm in impervious to this after watching the Browns for my entire life
[deleted]
Hard to say for sure but it feels like harden has a bigger impact than Durant on this team from the small sample size we have
But he don't
I've fallen in love with Dedmon

>Nah, he's gonna take a ~~day~~ few weeks off.

FTFY
***BAM***
Was it bad?
Cuz he played with Lebron.
It's not hard to say. Put Kyrie on the Blazers and they dont make the playoffs. Ever. But Dame on the Nets and that team is winning it all instead of getting steamrolled by the 76ers in 5.
You really threw Harlem’s name in there, huh? Might as well say Wade too... 🤣🤣🤣
shamet was hot in the last couple of minutes, but ofc he had to play hero ball lmao
He should’ve taken more...
That's our boy
are you being fr? I didint watch the game but thats the same shit he did vs giannis
Already said above, Bucks series flashbacks. That’s so funny
Lmao. I don't know why I'm dying at this
They're also a mentally weak team. Each of them have completely collapsed in the playoffs - Durant in 2016 OKC, Kyrie with the Celtics and Harden from OKC to Houston. If they start losing I wouldn't be surprised if they just let it completely slip away
Imma bring my popcorn
He was trying to ISO Bam
Kyrie was 0/8 when defended by Bam
its his aunts half birthday, excuse his personal leave
I love this sub lmao, kyrie plays well all year? Nothing to be said. He has a bad game? Clearly he’a leading this nets team into FAILURE!
honestly yeah a 6 game win streak will do that to you
when in doubt throw scissors
I’m rock hard rn, definitely gonna beat some scissors
The fact that a team that will finish 10 games or so under 500 will have a legit chance to make the playoffs is bullshit
you guys went to the finals last year just let us have the 6 seed pls and thank you
BAM
He said above average.
I don’t know bro those are clearly average numbers
No Jimmy, no Dipo. Next question
To retire ges
Bad luck with injuries and the riggedBA screwed us against the Heat in 2012, that ring was ours. Rather no ring than the shame of winning a mickey mouse ring in a Disney clubhouse gym. Feel bad your franchise will forever be stained with those cheap fkn Disney ringlets
He actually doesn’t. Durant has a +11 net rating with James harden off the floor while harden has a +3 net rating with Kd off the floor. Durant has the best impact on the team (when healthy ofc)

Thigh contusion is a basically a bruise. Won't know yet but it didn't look terrible. could be anywhere between a game to a few weeks though with KD.
didnt look like much
I mean you never know, this really just sounds like kyrie slander with no evidence though...
come on. redditors suggests that Spo didn't make any adjustments to cool down the hotter hand.

or just didn't watched the game at all.
I know that drill. It sucks.
Shamet was also hot, 30 points, but he decided to play hero ball and Shamet didn't see the ball the last four minutes lmao.
It was Tyler my bad. I wish there were like 3 or 4 seconds added to this clip to show Kyrie waving Brown off but this is it.

Man wtf is this weak ass narrative lmaooooo
I'll call the party bus company asap
r/nba: “Kyrie Irving sucks ass”

Also r/nba: “Nets are a super team with 3 superstars”
“Par for the course”. These people are clowns lol
Lol yeah. I’m not even a Kyrie fan like that but even I know that’s such a shitty reactionary take. Kyrie has been lights out all season.
“Kyrie fucked up so let me bring up something unrelated”
Yea right lmao pathetic fucking Knick fans
Scissors are so soft CULTURE always throws Rock!
This is only good advice within the context of that game. Otherwise it's a potential crime.
As someone who's team may be benefitted from it let me say this: The play in is an awful idea and I hope they get rid of it
Absolutely not. The energy of alonzo mourning shall always remain in miami.
BAM
Lol definitely my bad but even above average is wildly underestimating... he’s arguably 3rd best center behind jokic and embiid (KAT/gobert obviously right with him)
OP literally said "above average" but go off.
Forgot that Dipo and Jimmy = Harden and KD.
[deleted]
Kevin Durant has no rings.
This reads like a trump tweet, lol
If I understand correctly, that stat is misleading. Harden has more games where it’s just him without kyrie and KD, or with just Kyrie. Also all of his games were after his trade where the role players on the team are worse, most of KD’s games were before that trade so he had more of a supporting cast when he played.
I do enjoy Kyrie slander
Yeah, but Kyrie didn't help it either, dude just chucked contested shot after contested shot. I know he makes them quite often but I had 2012 Cavs flashbacks,
I couldn’t believe the shots Shamet was hitting. I’ve never seen him that hot before. Classic Kyrie. Pulled the same shit with Kevin Love back in the day.
You're talking ab a man who was upset he wasn't the team alpha vs LeBron James the goat. You think he's going to let Landry Shamet shine more than him???
Lol not quite as bad as if he did it against Bam but still pretty funny given how much better a defender Brown is. I didn’t watch the game so I appreciate you sharing that shit
Wait, what is this? Does the NBA keep clips of every stat that gets on the stat sheet? If so, that's amazing.
[This has a half second more](https://youtu.be/3ByTx555XDw?t=474)
seriously 2 weeks is a long time ago, even if we didn't have this win streak i still would have forgotten anyways lol
Bro chill, it’s just a game, Kyrie had one bad game. No big deal. Don’t need to be so aggressive
I know you're upset you guys blew that win, it's okay you can direct your anger at me i'll take it [because i love you](https://media.giphy.com/media/9RNGg4IQiufp6/giphy.gif)
It’s to de-incentive tanking. Usually 11 or 12 seeds would be tanking at this point in the year but now they have something to play for. It makes the league more competitive.
BAM
I would definitely put KAT above him and likely Gobert too. Calling the 5th best at a position that's historically weak above average seems about right.
Go easy, Heat fans can't read.
I’m responding to the comment right above but go off
Both teams were missing two of their top 3 players.
It was mostly David Stern trying to help Lebron but he's gone.
How are the role players worse? Levert/Allen aren’t impact players at their new teams. If anything guys Like Shamet/Tyler Johnson/Clax are better role guys than Levert/Allen. 

Harden only played 6 games without Kyrie and Kd. Kd played 4 games without Kyrie/harden. If you filter for Kd without Harden/Kyrie, Kd net rating is still better (+8) then Hardens (+5). Hardens cast with kyrie/Harris/shamet/Johnson/Clax is really good too. Cmon, don’t disregard numbers that disagree with your statement. Kd is the most impactful when healthy as he’s the best player on the Nets. 500 minutes is a pretty strong sample too. 

Kd also leads the team in plus minus on/off at +9 . There is just a lot of evidence that points to kd > Harden
They didn't have KD or Harden... y'all gotta realize that this team is really thin with its roleplayers, they aren't shot creators.
yeah. Kyrie said so. But it's more at coach staff to draw better plays for them.

like Spo did for Bam. Duncan was all time at corner to shoot a 3. just this facilitated to make a play or pass for Duncan.
What position is Kyrie officially in? At this point Kyrie is just a shooting guard right?
Yeah, it definitely wasn't as bad as it looked in real time lmao. That's my mistake.
They do! Just select a game and click play by play.
He hasn't ate all day
I get that but it just demerits the work of finishing 7th or 8th and clinching the playoffs normally, IMO the bad outweighs the good
I mean the Raptors are a 10 seed and are tanking. If a team feels like they aren't going to be competitive in the playoffs, it's always going to be in their best interest to tank.
BAM
Edrice
You must be 12 if you think the center position is historically weak
No man, you can’t tell me Allen and levert are worse than or as good as not having them on your team. Shamet, johnson, and Claxton were on the nets already, you’re trying to argue that it can be seen as a net positive for those players not being on your team lol, and saying Allen isn’t an impact player on the cavs who aren’t necessarily even trying this year or levert for the pacers who have been struggling all year is kind of a weak argument. The whole premise of my argument is that KD had a much better supporting cast than harden has had, and it’s wrong to say that Tyler frikin Johnson is arguably better than Allen or levert. It’s a small sample size since the trade because either kd or harden has always been injured really, but I’m just saying from the eye test that Harden has impacted winning more than KD. Imho the nets are a 2 seed without KD and not a 2 seed without harden
The thing is he does have pretty good vision so he could be an awesome point guard but the dude decides he wants to be the star. He still doesn’t realize that quarterbacks get the credit for the score, that somebody like Chris Paul scores through his teammates.
That combined with the hero ball at the end is still giving me some good, admittedly petty, schadenfreude though
https://tenor.com/view/yeah-that-brothers-starving-starving-gif-19331207
7 and 8 seeds rarely go past the first round, ending 7th or 8th isn't that much of an achievement.
It’s not that much work. Being 7th or 8th is like the midpoint. They rarely go anywhere in the playoffs. And if they can’t put away a team 10 games under .500 then why would you expect them to do anything in 7 games against a 1 or 2 seed?
BAM
Allen and levert are not better than Shamet (who had 30 pts today)/Claxton (whose a lot better defensively than Allen) and brown. Remember, Bruce brown didn’t even get playing time until harden was in Brooklyn. Harden had some of the best role guys in the league like Blake griffin/Bruce brown/shamet. 

Even if you filter for Durant without Levert/Harden, His team impact still trumps Hardens. 

Just as an exercise I filtered for Durant without Allen and Levert & in 400 minutes his net rating is +9 with a 120 offensive rating, still higher than Hardens. What’s your new excuse for Durant having higher team impact?

https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&Season=2020-21&SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&PlayerIds=201142,201935,1628386,1627747

Cmon Kd when healthy is the most impactful on the Nets by every metric.
“Imo Nets are not a 2 seed without Harden”

Because of the health of Durant? Then yes you’re probably right, but if Durant and kyrie are healthy then Brooklyn is vying for the 1 seed. Kd and kyrie have like a +12 net rating and they’re the best duo on the Nets offensively. Brooklyn’s 63% win % with Durant despite injuries is still easily the 2nd seed.  

When Durant is healthy, he blows harden away in all team impact metrics, even if you filter for No Levert or Allen, your argument is eye test? That makes zero sense lol. In games played, Durants on/off impact is higher than Kds too.

Why ignore all evidence and die on some weird hill lol? If you’re knocking Kd for health I agree otherwise he’s the most impactful by far
You managed to be good enough to end up in s playoff spot. Why should you have to play a team who wasn't good enough to make sure you get to go to the playoffs
To me, Harden has the biggest impact... He makes their offense go... KD is the best player on the team but it’s like Golden State all over again... KD was the best but Steph is what made the engine go... KD is going to drop 30 quietly... Harden is going to drop 25 with 10 assists which allows the role players to stay engaged offensively...
Yes. Allen and Levert are better than Shamet and Claxton, regardless it’s not like they acquired shamet and Claxton in the trade. If the nets had levert and Allen on their team right now they would be much better than they are now. Straight up. Also, +/- is not the metric we should be using to argue who impacts winning more, with small sample sizes it can be screwed by outliers (blowouts), earlier this year Portland had a negative +/- as a team but were a few games above .500.
Why don’t we use a different metric for how a player impacts actual winning. James harden is 27-7 this year with the Nets in his 34 games played (0.794%) and Kevin Durant is 15-9 this year with the Nets in his 24 games played (0.625%). Id say that’s a pretty big difference, and I’d argue that the circumstances favor Durant for reasons I’ve previously mentioned. Keep in mind this is all coming from a warriors fan who likes Durant far more than harden, I’m just trying to be as objective as possible.
Harden has won nearly 80% of his nets games and KD has won nearly 62.5% of his nets games. The team was underperforming before Harden arrived and since his arrival they have meshed a lot better and he’s impacted winning more. I’m just stating that from a casual Nets viewer who’s watched 15-20 nets games, they win more with harden. Not trying to knock KD, but if he wasn’t on this team they’d still be 2 seed is what I’m saying, and yes this is largely due to health, if all of them were healthy they’d be the 1 seed I’m sure.
Because if you lose to a play in  team you probably weren't that good to begin with.
Nope, Harris/Shamet/brown all had career games with Durant. Durant scoring gravity and passing really opens up shots for them. You don’t have to average 10 assists to be the engine. Harris talked about how Kd helps their offense by making a lot of space for them. Kd also has the highest offensive rating on the team
You can’t use record to imply who is impactful  more because it leaves a lot out...Kd was on a minutes restriction for 3 of those games and got ejected from 1 of them. And some of those were at the beginning of the season when team was jelling. Also, You make a good point with the blazers, they’re a bad team with a good record because Lillard won them games in the clutch, if you look at point differential and net rating, you can see they’re record is misleading.   

Also, I filtered for Durants impact without Levert and Allen, and it still comes out as Durant having More impact than harden....why ignore that? Why ignore the fact that even without Allen/Levert, Durant has higher team impact?

I’m just not understanding hardens argument for most impact on the Nets. Kd is making players better, scoring more, defending more, and having better team impact. Your argument falls apart when Kd without Allen and Levert still has better impact, sample size is still 300 minutes or more which is good. u/lildinger68
There’s an adjustment period you’re ignoring before harden came. Even when harden came they went 3-3 dropping games left and right.
Still better than the team you have to face, for the entire season nonetheless
The problem is it's also just one or two games. If a player is injured before or during that first or second play-in game, if a team just has a bad night, or a team matches up poorly then they lose the opportunity they played for in the regular season. It's obviously entertaining but it sucks if you are a player on those teams
My perspective was from the eye test as mentioned previously. From watching maybe 15-20 nets games this year, I was noticing that Harden was carrying the team to a lot of victories (nearly 80% like I said) and I was very impressed because it felt like he was doing the same as he was doing on the rockets, carrying teams to victories. I noticed Durant being better than I thought he would be coming back and all that stuff, but they’d still lose a lot of the games and started the team off sluggishly and frankly only picked it up once harden joined. I do think record is generally a good metric when the players are on the same team, more so than +/- at least because that is also largely impacted by rotations. For example, on the warriors Wiggins has a bad +/- on an average team, but that is because he plays 1/3 of his minutes with our trash bench, but it doesn’t mean he’s a bad player because he has a -2 +/-. Anyways, KD Getting ejected is on him and is not a valid excuse to not count it in the record, but the minutes restrictions plays a role for sure. KD is probably the better player and may have a bigger team impact, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that the Nets Harden has been winning considerably more than the Nets KD.
Durant is 4-1 on the season without Kyrie/harden while Harden is 4-2 on the season without Kd/kyrie. They both carried equally. Also, Nets during the win streak with Harden won 8 of those games by a single possession so isn’t there some luck involved there? Yes, Nets even started slow when Harden first went there, they started 3-4 bc of a gel period but I haven’t missed a Nets game this season so my test probably won’t fail me on this matter. 

You’re also forgetting Nets had Kd sit out 4 games with COVID to start the year & kyrie took a sabbatical so that impacted their record. Then KD went on a 3 game win streak by himself & harden came, the team struggled at first then hit stride. This is why it’s better to look at team metrics, bc record leaves context out. KD with Westbrook & Iffy role players had multiple 60 win seasons in a much harder conference lol, the problem rn is he isn’t healthy, when healthy his team impact is better than hardens
Cavs had 70 points in the paint, 27 made free throws, and a 62-32 rebounding advantage.  Just absolute bully ball.
HOW DID WE GET JARRETT ALLEN LMAO
League is boring with superteams like the Cavs
WHEN YOU TRY SEXLAND WITH A SORRY DEFENDER LIKE IRVING, THATS THE RESULT YOU GON’ GET
[deleted]
“We’re just not good enough” - James Harden
Cavs in 4 in the ECF
Is Cleveland legit this year? They've taken down some good teams this year.
The Cavs are 6-2 when Sexton or Garland play. The Cavs are a good team.
THE EAST RUNS THROUGH CLEVELAND
That was a really solid cruise to a win. Cavs never felt out of control.
IRVING OUTDATED

HARDEN OVERRATED

LONG HAVE WE WAITED

NETS PICK ACTIVATED
Clippers trading Shamet for Kennard was absolute robbery.
Are the cavaliers the best team in the NBA?
We are coming. We might miss the playoffs, but we are coming.
If the Cavs aren’t careful, they might make the playoffs.

Assuming we actually make it there.
Imagine getting Harden with KD and Kyrie and getting curb stomped by the cavs twice in a row
Harden thought Sexland was a strip club
Cavs won the harden trade
[deleted]
Cavs deserve some credit, they are actually looking real nice with solid defense.
Harden guarding centers is not going to cut it.
[deleted]
[deleted]
this team can make up for Kevin Love's defense, and needs his added offense. 

we're a good team when healthy. Elite D and an average offense. My dream is sending drummond + our future drafts for a stud and let's go to work because it seems like the next best thing for developing these young guys is to get them into some important games.
You step foot in SexLand, you best believe you're getting fucked
There’s never been a title team this bad defensively. People putting them in the Lakers tier are nuts
Big 3 exposed in SexLand
SEX
The Cavs are officially better than the Nets.
I cant believe I spent a whole offseason saying the league robbed us last year because they knew the east run through us only to actually be competitive this year.

Silver got scared smdh.
clock winds down to 5 seconds left in game

ball is inbounded to Kyrie who turns face to face against Sexton

"You took my family"

moves to the left

"You took my friends"

moves to the right

"You took all that was dear to me"

clock winds down to 2

"I cant get them back, but I can do this for friendship, FOR MY FRIENDS"

goes up, fire coming out of his shoes

"KYRIERUKEN"

Ball flies over Sexton’s head, goes straight into basket. Kyrie falls to the ground, exhausted.

"Drake... Senpai... I..."

faints

Final Score

Cavs 125

Nets 113
With the Harden trade, the ceiling is higher, but the floor is lower.
How kind of the Nets to help the Cavs improve their offense stats
ARE THE CAVS BETTER WITHOUT LEBRON?!
And we’ll still be ranked 30 in ESPNs power ranking
Nets with Harden before Kyrie returned: undefeated,  neva lost 

Nets with since Kyrie returned: Winless, neva won, lost by double digits to Sex Man twice in 3 days
In conclusion...
Y'all really overreacted over one game. r/nba always does this shit man. This team has so much talent, no way they were gonna let the Nets take them to 2OT again
Everybody get the fuck in here
Cavs really got Jarrett Allen for a late first and Andre Drummond for a second. Cavs front office is playing chess while some of these guys are playing checkers.
Collin Sexton is the best Cavs player ever to wear #2.
J.B. Bickerstaff for COTY.  How do you keep your team at .500 when you literally only have 1 healthy combo guard?
If one of the big three happens to be out for the playoffs, Nets are a first round exit.
thought the Nets looked terrible without Durant. If he goes down I think this team is a 7 or 8 seed. I know that that is the deal with big 3 teams because you generally trade away all your depth but damn just no defense or rebounding and not the insane offense to overcome those deficiencies. Could they have held on to Allen if they had traded Kyrie? 

Honestly though it made me think how insane LeBron in 2018 was, missing 2 of the 3 main pieces. Just ridiculous.

The Cavs are super fun man. So athletic, good ball movement, some moments of brilliance from sexton, people are right to be excited about their future. Having said that, the Nets horrible defense made them like a 130 pt pace team haha
imagine mortgaging your whole future in a win-now trade, but also trading away all the necessary guys you'd need to actually win-now.
Unfair to the Nets to have the play the Cavs. EAST RUNS THRU CLEVELAND
A Nets fan actually said to me: "Laker fans are so scared right now." LMAOOOOO
Man it’s going to be weird facing Lebron in the finals this year
I could get used to this.
Not joking if these two teams meet in the first round Cavs in 6.
Pretty much my entire life the Cavs have been soft and didn't play defense.

Now all we do is hustle and play defense. I fuckin love it.
Isaac Okoro looks likes he been in the league for 9 years
**Nets fans on Wednesday:** “We’ll see how Friday goes”

**Friday:**
The East runs through Cleveland
Why does it feel like even with some moves the Nets are most likely going to make. The Big 3 is going to have to play 40+ Mins and score 100+ points.
Why do they keep Tyler Johnson glued to the bench when Shamet can't hit a shot to save his life is what I wanna know.
Damn nets can't guard a parked car
Cavs got sexton from the kyrie trade, which a lot of people ruled a disaster for the cavs by mid season 2018
don’t sleep on the Cavs
Cavs are fun to watch.
The offense is not a problem for the Nets. Their offense is elite but that defense is straight up like butter. Players are having career games out there against that defense.
Sex god. They can't stop him, they can only hope to contain him
If only the nets had one more all star they may have had a chance against this super team of a cavs squad
jarrett allen and collin sexton destroying betters' entire life savings in two games
Cavs 2020-21 NBA champs
I thought the Cavaliers made a huge mistake when they gave JB Bickerstaff an extension. 

I don’t think I’m cut out to be a GM
I love this Cavs team. SexLand is so much fun.
Uh oh the cavs are playing playoff basketball
I have no clue what’s going on with Harden right now.
Kyrie getting all the criticism while Harden has gotten locked up by Okoro 2 games in a row. You guys just love to hate him man.
i think the defense is an obvious problem for the nets, but also length. Cavs with an adavantage when it came to rebounding. a plus of around 20 rebounds seems much.
We all know Cleveland won the Kyrie trade. Did Cleveland also win the Harden trade??
Harden looking lazy.

Looked the same way in his final games with us.

Thought he was just not trying but he’s just looked off lately
Kyrie has 75pts on 55% FG these last 2 games but watch people blame him
Is anyone else surprised by how mobile Andre Drummond is for a big guy?
Lakers in 5 

&#x200B;

Cleveland on the other hand...
Cavs just took it to the nets lmao
They're getting rid of Irving.

Harden needs more shots and is a better fit with KD.

Crazy that Irving might still get moved in the end after everything.
Nance becoming very draymondy
The Nets could use someone like Jarrett Allen
Guys, I don't mean to brag, but the Nets just called me up. They said they had a look at my college intramural basketball tape from ten years ago, and think I could really upgrade their bench.
Cavs defense is really good. When they pulled away it was by forcing multiple turnovers and scoring on the break. Great win.
Both games lost by 12. Guess KD is a drag on the team. Trade him for depth
Lol cavs are the nets daddy
Cavs might be the worst matchup for this years nets team besides the lakers tbh just too big and Drummond is such a work horse on the glass when harden is starting at the “4” it’s a problem against a team like this
I have never been alive to see a playoff caliber Cavs team that is really fun to watch that doesn't feature LeBron James. Until now.
Showtime Cavs are highly entertaining.
Cavs really got Allen for a bucks 1st rounder ..... what were the rockets thinking lol ...
Holy shit.  They beat them twice?!  😂
Sexton with a cool 25/9. Is he a star?
People can’t fathom CLE being a decent team without LBJ.  Well, shit happens.
I can't believe the Nets traded one of the most easiest guys to root for in the NBA
EAST RUNS THROUGH CLEVELAND
Really sad to see the downfall of these once great veteran players, here is a stat that will shock you, Both Kevin Love and Kevin Durant scored ZERO points tonight.
Give me Lakers vs Cavs finals please

 Man, the cavs are going to the finals
Turns out a 3 headed team isn’t great for depth when you trade the better part of a roster for one guy.  They will probably figure it out offensively with KD out there but I expect this team to be a poor defensive team
It's even funnier the second time
collin is an all-star
Like between Drummond, Allen and McGee the Cavs are low key stacked at C.
Im just waiting to see who else can expose the nets D like the cavs its fun to watch lol
Nets trying to acquire Collin Sexton.
This is what happens when you trade your branch for a star you don't really need.
What the actual fuck are the nets supposed to do against Embiid if the cavs are bullying them down low?
This whole winning games thing is nice. I think we should keep doing it.... But I also want one more chance at a top 5 pick.

I'm so torn.
People saying Kyrie is the only reason it's not a blow out doesn't understand what they are watching. Kyrie's style isn't effective, he doesnt get players involved enough and simply wants to score most the time. That wouldn't be a problem but Harden and KD are better scorers and he's not taking a back seat for Harden particularly. Harden is less effective because Kyrie shoots 10x more than him. Same thing happened with the Celtics where he took shots away from players, he simply doesn't play winning basketball.
Maybe people should have waited for them to play some games before deciding they'd win the championship easy eh? Super team? Not yet. Maybe they'll gel later
The Cavs remind me of the Grizzlies last year, and the Kings the year before that. Just a young team with no expectations, but a lot of energy and confidence
The East still runs through Cleveland
A lot of talk will be about the nets not meeting expectations but If you watch this cavs team you know that they are actually really pretty good. Our defense keeps us in games even when shots aren’t falling. With our defense it feels like we can beat anybody on any given night. We’re also like 2 deep at every position. I really think we will surprise people this year
KD scared to play against these cats
Is it October, because the Cavs are starting to look spooky
THE EAST RUNS THROUGH SEXLAND
It's pretty cool that Cleveland looks like a half decent team fairly quick after Bron left them and they seemed stuck in cap hell after that. They've looked pretty damn good this year but it's still early in the Nets run. Nowhere near title contender but I'd love for them to be a fun surprise in the East
I'm a believer in Cleveland and Collin Sexton is my god
Can KD win with these cats?
"Were just not good enough and I dont think this can be fixed"

-Harden on the Nets
I need that goofy  "and I'll Fucking do it again" in a Cavs jersey.
I’m glad youngbull has become a great player now. Sexland combo gonna be nasty
Cavs have really increased their pace the last two games
Cavs out of meme territory much faster than i’ve expected after Lebron left for the 2nd time.
Sexland > Brookland
NBA Finals. Game 7. Cavs up one over the Lakers. Two seconds left. Lebron with the pull up...
Sex man leads sexland through the east baby
Where's the my next chapter memes?
Man the Nets Defence is so bad, you would think Rudy Guliani was running it.
Kyrie is hogging that ball like hell... he's gonna destroy that team.

Plus, 3 top players in iso points in the league in ONE team?

Good lord. The rest of the roster must absolutely HATE playing in this team. No wonder that any effort from the opposition results in a L for the nets.
Cleveland won the trade?!
I wish the nets nothing but failure
All star teams fail because they rely solely on the individual talent real teams take that talent and put it in a system that is designed to beat the individual talent. - herb brooks
[deleted]
This Brooklyn team cannot defend. Holy shit are they bad on that end of the floor
Why is this so funny to me?
THE SEXMAN
This should be civil...
sex ed again lmao
Cavs beat them by 12 points two games in a row
Nets took an L trading their defence, Defence wins you titles.
THE EAST RUNS THROUGH SEXLAND
I’d like to say a prayer for the Nets’ social media manager that has to deal with constant shitposts and responses. Rip
We need something for the Cavs in the same vein as what the Suns bros would spam when they'd win.
Watching Drummond do post moves hurt my eyes. Watching Jarrett Allen destroy the nets hurt my heart
hhaaaaahahahahahahahaaaaha
I'm not tryna knock the Cav bigs but watching the Celts-Sixers game tonight, I got a feeling Joel will single-handedly drop the Nets out of the playoffs if they meet. This is absolutely embarrassing D.
Sorry Bucks and Nets. The East belongs to the Cavs... AGAIN! 😂🤣
I guess the East still runs through the Cavs huh
Prince and Allen gotta be pinching themselves, going from the outhouse to the penthouse.
This team is supposed to challenge the lakers?
Once Kyrie inevitably gets injured, the nets will cruise to the finals.
So soft. That whole trio some pussies. And yes I know KD didn't play tonight.
I was like ''it is a bit late for this topic as its been a few days'' then I realized 'Oh yea, they do play the same teams back to back' and saw the score.

Man, can you imagine THIS be the playoff matchup? And THIS be the result?

 'James Harden-PF' ... Jesus Nets, why?
So far the Kyrie Harden fit has looked terrible and I'm totally not overreacting
Nets should try to get javale since Cavs don’t need him
Harden calling his agent to demand a trade.
The nets organisation is probably looking at this embarrassing lack of rebounding, defence, rim protection etc thinking; we need more offence
They will only get sgronger when you put Love in SexLand
The east still runs through Cleveland
I saw this thread and was like oh that happens yesterday, but it happened again today. I’m dying lmao
Cavs punished Kyrie badly for all the times he didn’t go back.
It’s almost like trading the only guy on the team who plays defense and rebounds is a bad idea.
i cant believe cleveland sport turn in around their franchise with baker and sexland
I LOVE Collin Sexton. He is my own. Dude is going to make them a playoff contender. He is amazing. People think others are doing well but hes enabling everyone.
This is genuinely one of the most fun cavs teams i’ve seen, i was yelling and cheering because of how much effort they put in on defense, i love it so much
This is amazing, the nets suck!
Kyrie is so much worse at everything than Harden— and he refuses to even be 1b. If Brooklyn can find a fair trade partner they should do it.
Harden: “Us 3 together...scary hours”


#scary bad
So are we actually good or
It has been really fun as a Cavs fan looking at the young guys continuously improving and winning games.
Twas the cavs who formed the Superteam all along!
so uhhhhhh, apparently the east runs through cleveland now?
29-50 reb difference cmon
I practically lost my voice with elation watching the game Wednesday. Couldn’t tune in until the half, and was expecting that the last win may have been a fluke. Was pleasantly surprised by a one point lead, but nothing could prepare me for what I was to witness. What a fun game to watch. Coin flip on a Sexman or Allen Jersey.
Before anyone says “OMG OVERREACTION”, I’ve been firm that they shoulda traded Kyrie before they ever played their first game together. You might be able to get defensive guys and fill the gap in the roster with waiver signings, but that’s a gamble. A good team around KD and harden is more than enough to win a chip. Harden and an ancient cp3 almost beat KDs dynasty team. You don’t need kyrie.
Ok who let the cavs be good
I feel like Kyrie is too selfish of a player for this to work. Harden needs the ball more than Kyrie does.
If a first round matchup happens with an 8th seed cavs faces a 1 seed nets, i’m putting my savings on the cavs and making $$$
what

the fuck

The Cavs are officially the most exciting team in the league
Alright let us have a run at these clowns
Nets were looking like they would make ECF minimum this year before the Harden trade. Levert off the bench was unfair because he is very much a starter on most teams.The starting 5 tonight for Brooklyn were 4 guards and Deandre Jordan LOL 😂.
Im here wondering whats with the Kawhi pic? 😆
At least this didn't go to OT
Basketball, in essence, is all about matchups
Nets got so tunnel visioned on getting Harden they forgot they still needed someone like Prince and especially Allen lmao
T-this is insane...I was sorta scared of the Nets due to their insane depth, and collection of all-star caliber players, KD/Kyrie/Caris/Dinwiddie/DeAndre/Jarrett. But now? Dinwiddie is out for now, DeAndre playing like trash (compared to what I know he can do), Caris/Jarrett got traded. And the big 3 as good as they are, trust me I know how good those players are individually, they can’t guard a pick up team at the YMCA, let alone proper NBA team. At the start I wanted Caris/Spencer/Jarrett/ 2 first round picks for Harden, but now even without those? Trade looks like a major W for everyone but Brooklyn.
seeing the cavs beating contenders, making good trades, and in playoff contention in a post-lebron era just feels surreal.
Nets are the worst team in the NBA.
*laughs in ACTUAL lifelong Rockets flair*
Watch them meet in the first round and the Cavs sweep em
Listen CAVS will be in the ECF
It's worrying that it looks like none of the three can really afford to sit any games. This game was decided by rebounds and freethrows - Nets need to do better than a 50-29 total REBs margin if they want to consistently win games. Also 27 Cav points from FTs versus 15 for the Nets. Watching the first half it just looked like Harden couldn't get to the line like he usually does, while at the other end of the floor Jarrett Allen was having his way in the paint. 

It's really hard to tell how much of this is the Nets struggling versus the Cavs rolling - I really like the Allen pick up for the Cavs, and Sexton is coming into his own. Garland looked pretty shakey at points out there but I imagine some of that is just rust which he'll shake off. One thing's for sure though - people saying that Nets games would be must-see basketball because of their insane offence and lack of defence were right! I'll take 'enjoying Nets Cavs games' for things I didn't expect to be saying in 2021.
No depth and no D
Jarrett Allen is a monster but imagine Embiid, Jokic, AD against this Nets team 😬😬
It's Offical, Cleveland has the worst strip clubs...
The nets are a shit team.
For a second I was like, "What's this days-old link doing on my front page?" and then, "OOOooohhh, I see."
If the lakers dont win the chip again. Lebron in Cleveland round 3.
There are some absolute gems in this thread. You guys are relentless. Lol
This Nets team will continue to struggle against teams with decent bigs unless one or two happens. 

They go small ball like Houston did last year or they find another big to play with Deandre Jordan
James Harden Finna demand a trade outta Brooklyn
Hahaha kill me 😂
Bro taurean prince was looking like kd out there
I don't know if there are many people that think the Nets will be a powerhouse because of the three superstars on their roster now, I am sure there are, but I can tell you with certainty this team is going to crash and burn. 

Durant is fine and he can fit anywhere, even though he is softer than the cheapest tissue paper, Harden and Kyrie are going to make Durant wish he was still a Warrior. The reason the Warriors worked so well was because of so many unselfish players on that roster. They basically let Durant do his thing and they followed him, even though Klay and Steph are stars in their own right. Imagine Kyrie's isolation ball in the playoffs, or Harden's... that never works and it is why the Rockets kept flaming out in the playoffs. 

Steph and LeBron may be vastly different players in skillsets but one thing they are both pretty good at is playing unselfish ball. LeBron is still on another level when it comes to that ability and elevating his teammates, but Steph is not bad either.
Guess Nets didn't guard Collin Sexton again
This would be different if it was just KD and Harden. Sit out Kyrie next time, better yet let him go missing again.
Kevin Durant made a wise business decision
thought the Nets looked terrible without Durant. If he goes down I think this team is a 7 or 8 seed. I know that that is the deal with big 3 teams because you generally trade away all your depth but damn just no defense or rebounding and not the insane offense to overcome those deficiencies. Could they have held on to Allen if they had traded Kyrie? 

Honestly though it made me think how insane LeBron in 2018 was, missing 2 of the 3 main pieces. Just ridiculous.

The Cavs are super fun man. So athletic, good ball movement, some moments of brilliance from sexton, people are right to be excited about their future. Having said that, the Nets horrible defense made them like a 130 pt pace team haha
Harden about to put that fat suit on and try to get traded again.
sex man > looking for sex man
Cavs run the east now😂🤣
This is embarrassing.
out rebounded by 20+ 😶😶😶
Cavs are just better than the Nets that’s a fact
Kyrie’s got that ball on a string like no other. But man does it feel good to see wins again. Nets better hope a big man gets bought out cuz sheesh. Jordan ain’t it.
[deleted]
THEY DID IT AGAIN BOYS. THE EAST RUNS THROUGH CLEVELAND
James Harden is going to end his career like Phillip Rivers man
Nets can't guard a traffic cone.
Sexton gettin the broom out
Jarrett Allen is a beast.
LETS FUCKING GO
Jarret allen had the same amount of points as harden in less mins therfore the harden trade was a mistake
Why did nets trade allen again? He’s an up and coming youngster who is doing great fro the nets and is very cheap. Also he’s better than deandre jordan at this point.
Wtf is this thumbnail
[deleted]
Nets are the Clippers 2.0
Shamet.. baby what u doing
People saying Kyrie can’t be blamed are only watching the box score and not the game. Yeah Kyrie got his buckets, but he didn’t get any of his teammates involved. He ISOs almost every time he touches the ball. Kyrie’s playing as if to tell team that he’s the alpha. Not the two MVPs with him.

It’s only the 2nd game of the big three though. Let’s see how they adjust.
Harden going to the one team with a more unlikeable star. Savvy veteran move.
We all knew the Nets would have depth issues...but fuck this is even worse than we thought.
"KD can't a championship with those cats" -Not KD
Hey who knew tall guys are good for basketball teams?!
I remember Someone commented on my post about Nets' flaws on offense saying "relaxed kid, it's only on game"

Well bruh it's 2 already on the same week. So sad tha Nets fans can't seem to take criticism about their new big three smh
Didn’t watch the game but I’m assuming Nets D blows??
Sexton da god
East runs thru the cavs
Lmao what did anyone expect😂 it's gonna be 3vs10 players for brooklyn almost every game. All those stats from their big 3 won't mean shit against any complete team.
WHAT IS HAPPENING!!???
If you would have told me two years ago that a Nets/Cavs back to back was a must see series, I would have told you to shut the fuck up.
Hory shet
Rockets absolutely fleeced us
Kyrie insane but Sexland is just better?
Start of the Kyrie-as-Starscream storyline
I don't think the nets have one good defensive player.
Again??
We got a [expletive] squad now!
"The east run through cleveland"

We just didnt know what year
Starting Harden at PF not such a good.  Huh.
Fuck it, I’ll do it again meme
So are the Cavs good now or did the Nets fuc up?
Schadenfreude is pretty deep in here...
Hardest road
How much gel do the Nets need to beat this Cavs team. lmao.
29 TREB bruh 29 !!
Wait again??? They played and beat em again ?
[this video explains why the nets season is going poorly](https://youtu.be/rD23ime71vo)
Yo Cleveland,  let's trade
And for the second game in a row, the combo of Taurean Prince and Jarrett Allen substantially outscored James Harden.

Wait, Harden started at power forward what the fuck?
Nets have a terrible bench. Just no depth. I’m really interested how they match up against MVP level Embiid and Simmons
THE SEXMAN FROM THE SEXLAND STRIKES AGAIN
I'd still pick the Nets in a 7 game series
Just watch out in the playoffs, KD would have the ball in the locker room and still won't be called for out of bounds.
I'm starting to think James Harden paired up with Kyrie isn't very effective.
Wait did Harden really play PF??
i am sure this will be a reasonable thread with minimal overreactions and intelligent long term takes
That’s awesome
AGAIN?!?
This is beautiful
I'll somehow be more angry at Kyrie for occupying so much of my headspace the last few weeks if the Nets don't get a big man and end up getting swept.
Did anyone else laugh as it says "James Harden, Power Forward"
Even after all these years those nets picks are still haunting them.. now in physical manifestation
Sexton is a PROBLEM
Harden only shooting 4 free throws brings me joy
This is for you
If you told me in 2017 that Lebron James was going to lose the NBA finals in 2021 but the Cleveland Cavaliers were going to win I would’ve laughed at you
Who knew adding a career loser with a bad attitude would go so bad....but that’s none of my business.
this cleveland team is so fun
Didnt expect Cleveland to do this good
As someone who watched the Cavs cause of Lebron, im legit happy to see them out of the gutter and playing ball. I knew Sexton was gonna be good but holy shit he is going off.
Colin Sexton just sonned Kyrie damn
Tfw Joe Harris grabbed a team-high 7 rebounds
Nets defense makes the Cavs offense look like the Nets.
“I don’t think I have ever played in a superteam”

No shit Lebron, you bailed on Sexton for AD
They doubled down lol
SEXLAND
Do we have a squad?
The East fucking runs through Cleveland baby.
PnR defense by the Nets was horrid. Just awful both games.
Clippers fans are loving this Nets team right now lol

The Reddit dorks completely forget about you guys
Siiiick!
The Nets: Beat the Bucks first game after the trade

Also the Nets: Drop 2 in a row to the 29th ranked Cavs offense.

Why do I even try to enjoy basketball
The Nets currently have a losing record with Kyrie AGAIN.

4-5 with him; 5-3 without him.

I know, I know.  Small sample size. New players. Need time to build chemistry.

But Harden and KD, on their first game, beat the Bucks.  Kyrie + Harden lose to the Cavs, and KD, Kyrie, and Harden ALSO lose to the Cavs?

They'll build chemistry of some sort throughout the season... enough to have a top four-seed record I'm sure, but this pattern of teams doing better without Kyrie is not looking good.
I’m not putting this on Kyrie or Harden, if it weren’t for them, we would’ve gotten BLOWN OUT by 20+. Our non-stars have to hit their open shots. So many open looks created by Harden’s/Kyrie’s playmaking that were missed. Defense is tremendous across all boards. Idk why we attempted so many 3s instead of trying to drive and draw some fouls (must have something to do with D’Antoni smh). I’m not gonna overreact because I know this is gonna take some time, but we NEED a big man. Hopefully we can get a Javale McGee to help out with pain protection and rebounding. 

On the other hand, I’m so happy for Allen man. Dude is flourishing with the Cavs. Cavs fans must be ecstatic lol. They have a good young team with good coaching.

I expect us to play better tomorrow against Miami with KD back and rested. Hopefully we make some improvements and get a win. GG Cavs fans.
If Sex has million number of fans i am one of them . if Sex has ten fans i am one of them. if Sex have only one fan and that is me . if Sex has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth . if world against the Sex, i am against the world. i love #Sex till my last breath.. .. Die Hard fan of Sex . Hit Like If you Think Sex Best player & Smart In the world
GG Cavsbros. You got an exciting young budding squad there that can give anyone a run for their money and should have plenty of nice quality wins throughout the season. Still a way to go before you're a serious threat but I think this team has a really nice foundation to build from and I'm excited to see where you go from here. I know people throw "young core" around a lot and it gets tiring but this team really has a lot of nice pieces that can be the foundation of something great down the road (sucks KPJ had to be a fuckin psycho because tbh I was highest on his upside out of all the guys but oh well, they'll be fine without him) Reminds me a lot of the Nets before KD/Kyrie.
lol
Nets aint winning shit, their defense and depth is some of the worst in the NBA.
Lakers gonna repeat, you can already see it happening lmao.
KD, Harden and Irving got another round of lessons of Sex Ed


I mean, they got *spanked*
All en SexLand
Sexton is a ton of sex
i'm getting PTSD. STOP IT CLEVELAND!!!! IT'S NOT FAIR!!!!
The Brooklyn Rockets
What’s more likely- Cavs sweeping the Nets in two games or me scoring a PS5?
I just came out of a 3 year coma, seems like the Cavs still run the East?
Nets with the Heatles 3 identity crisis lol
The Nets defense is fucking atrocious
league on notice
Kyrie couldn’t miss but it also seemed like he was getting abused in the pick and roll, so who is really the winner
Well their defense and rebounding is a lot worse than I thought
gg
Even though I expected this I’m still shocked
Again?!
From to championship or bust to maybe playoffs or bust
Why does Harden get so few shots even when KD is out?
Feel it was a bit early to pull the starters out at 2:30 left in the game
The east really runs through them.
That rebound differential...

People were really trying to talk themselves into thinking Deandre wasn't washed.
Allen looks so good
How long until Kyrie's next leave of absence?
Kyrie to the Knicks for some young defensive pieces
That defense cannot be fixed just by filling the roster out unless they get a major good player , harden looks so passive
The Cavs is a playoff team!
That Nets defense looking SPo0kY
East still runs through the Cavs
Uh oh! Seems like our little Brooklyn friends are in need of some defence
THE EAST STILL RUNS THROUGH CLEVELAND
Nets is going to explode after this season. No depth at all.
I can’t wait for the second counter jerk
the Nets have 3 exemptions to use to find ways to shore up the defense. they've had like 1 practice all together and KD/Kyrie/harden have played literally 1 game together. when you spend that much on 3 guys, you need them all and they need to have time on the court together.
50 to 29 total rebounds. 

Deandre Jordan played 26 minutes to contribute 9 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 blocks, and 4 turnovers. Dude’s not good.
SCARY HOURS
NORVEL PELLE will save this team!!!
Brooklin Nets lookin more like the Brooklin Rims with those 3PT numbers
I'll take a Lowry charge over an Embiid foul bait any day
James Harden PF lemao
The ultimate Bucks hangover, or something.
Great now the Nets will feel disappointed in themselves and will play a revenge game against my injured, busted ass shallow rostered team.
Kyrie gives no fucks about winning - just get dem stats dog
IT’S GONNA BE A MOVIE THEY SAID
Getting real tired of this shit
Having kyrie is a problem, and not a good one at that. He disrupts their offense too much, he’s like Lou Williams(on steroids) that fails to acknowledge his placement on the team(third best)
Taurean Prince fits like a glove
We couldn’t actually win... right?
this team :))
Kyrie fails with the Cavs till Lebron returns to carry him. The only time Celtics don't make conference finals is with Kyrie playing full season. The Nets were not doing good when it was just Kyrie last year with no KD. Now that Kyrie has been back he's getting schooled by a two year point guard and Nets are on a two game losing streak. There is a common theme here.
Missed the game. What the hell happened? Didn't expect the Nets to lose twice to the Cavs wtf...
The Nets lost against a team with a retired player (D. Wade)
Scary hours!!
Nets desperately need more bigs.
Why was KD out tonight?
what
I didn’t watch the game. Where was Durant tonight?
Once again the golden state warriors have a better record than Brooklyn nets (win rate wise) 😂😂
Wtf?
More like Shamdry am I right?
Harden need to take over games for the Nets to win. He’s trying too hard to be unselfish teammate. Makes no sense when you only takes 14-15 FG when you are one of the best offensive player.
Trade Dinwiddie for a good center.
Kyrie out here taking 10 more shots than Harden...Smh
Wait why am I living through this nightmare again? Didn't this happen already
Imagine what the Sixers are gonna do to this Nets defense if they let Cleveland bully them like this...
the amount of people that were saying to smash nets ML today, thats when you know you gotta fade the game
This is news?
Is this 2000s basketball?? BIGMEN?? PAINT POINTS?? AND DEFENSE?? GOD DAMN
Holy shit boys.
CORRETT SEXLLEN!!
Nets were the imposters.
Nets got roasted on all sides.
14 FGA again by Harden. Didn't watch the game but WTF?
So.... trade Kyrie will be the sports show talk till they win a game
The Nets without KD are very poorly matched-up against the Cavs, it's a nothing game. Don't have to watch the game to see that, you can see by all of Clevelands bigs' fg % and rebounds.
Bro what is happening lmao
I legit refreshed front page a couple times thinking it had glitched from the last game thread.
I'm getting major clipper vibes with this Nets team. You can see they have the talent but we keep waiting for them to dominate like we think they should, and we get it from time to time, but not on a consistent basis.
Sexton and Drummond been balling out. Hope they keep this going and make the playoffs
No KD? Chill.
Cavs in 4
Dayummmm
WHAT YEAR IS IT
Again?
The Nets have a real paint issue. They can’t rebound for shit
Harden about to Jeremy Lin Kylie
Cavs with a winning record out here!

Big blessing

I love the team this year
So, is it too early to say that Harden and Kyrie don't look like they can play together effectively? Harden and KD looked solid.
On one hand it’s from Cleveland.
Your basketball team is worse off if Kevin Durant gets injured.
best out of 5?
That can’t look weird. Post it”
I was ready to take a break after an amazing Browns season. But damn these Cavs are becoming must see TV too.
So much for a super team
Harden real deal doesn’t move without the ball
Cleveland reporter: "So draymond is kind of hilarious.
This isn’t even Cleveland’s final form... They have a KLove.
I still think it’s way too early to judge the Nets, but the results have definitely looked disappointing so far. They’ll go on a hot streak some time this regular season and everyone will say “lol duh they traded role players for HARDEN of course we all knew they’d be good.” 

I think the key honestly is for Harden to take more control. He probably doesn’t want to come in and create bad energy with his new superstar teammates so he’s been more of a passer to make sure they get theirs. But when he took 25 shots against the bucks, they won without Kyrie. The last 2 games he took 14 shots each and deferred to others
Wow cabs rebuilt fast, wonder what the future for Drummond is though
Post a pic of you? Honestly.
u/salimahmad2010
Post it on r/unexpected
The East runs through Cleveland!
You know what’d be hilarious? If teams kept trading the cavs roster with each other so that the nets only play against sexton Drummond Allen and the other cavs on that roster for the rest of the season.
What a weird timeline. But Cavs look good, they have a big strong team with decent shooters on it. If SexManLand turn it on, they might actually at near the top of their division. That Allen and Prince trade really made this team a good team.
Post that in r/nba all night lol
AM I A CAVS FAN NOW?
lol nets are so garbage. They are not even close to contenders.
Cleveland run the east
Lebron about to force himself out of LA to go back home....again.
Hey, hey, I've seen this one. This is a classic.
Man this was my problem with this Nets team, neither of those stars are known to play defense, smh. They can’t beat that Lakers team, they need a shot blocker
Allen‘s afro could win games by itself.
The team that gets all of the Nets picks
Wait. What? 
How?
Again?
Are the Cavs.....good?
>It’s ok we have the Nets tommrow
John Wall rn: https://www.instagram.com/p/CKSnv8CHHuL/?igshid=1gl7z4eachjbi
Nets need dinwiddie back BADLY
What can kyrie do except score? He's not a good leader and he isn't a defensive stopper.
Sexland!!!
As it turns out scheme means something. You can't just throw talent at a problem....
The Comic Sans at the end makes me cry
The thumbnail for this thread is Kawhi and the Clippers????? 😂
The bench and defence of the Nets needs to be re-worked badly.
Sellout Nets are living up to their name !
Kevin love?
How long until the nets fall apart? Counting the days..
The Cavaliers run New York
Are we spooky now
Clubhouse invites for sale. Hmu if you’re interested
The Nets have, like, the Sun/Venus/Saturn on their team, and somehow get beat twice by Mercury/Mars. Doesn’t add up.
Ahahahaahha the nets fucked
Nets will need time
And to add to the roster defensively to move forward but they will figure things out
Net is full of shit
Why not just rename this the Nets hate thread?
Lmao
Cavs has been surprising me so far this season...
People can't seem to grasp that the Nets are basically a new team after the trade, its like their season just started   and they are currently lacking options, they have been playing Jeff Green like it's 2007. Give them time to fix these issues. The Cavs are not bottom feeders anymore, most players have improved every season and they never quit. Nets are the team to beat in the East.
Goddamn I love basketball
Harden taking only 14 shots and 4 ft is crazy.
I’m here to overreact
Is anyone really surprised? Anyone with a clue was saying this team was bad defensively and poor depth the moment the trade went down and now we’re already seeing the effects of that 4 games in. Never mind the fact that their  coach was literally covering soccer games less than two years ago
THE EAST STILL RUNS THROUGH CLEVELAND. CAVS IN 3
The East runs through Cleveland.
The East still runs through Cleveland
okay so these dudes REALLY cant defend. Teams aint gonna be afraid of them after the cavs b\*tched them two nights in a row
Cavs are going to the finals. Calling it right now.
The east runs through the Cavs
Anytime I see Irving the artist lose I’m happy. Harden as well. Rich bums!
At this point I genuinely don’t know who the fuck is getting #2 retired for the cavs. Give him a few years and sexton could’ve leading the cavs to the finals
Y'all are overreacting..... they've played a handful of games together...
I would literally rather have Jarrett Allen on the Nets than Kyrie
Kyrie is gonna have the highest usage rate on the nets over KD and Harden isnt he?

Also my old thread coming true:

https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kn5zfg/anyone_see_this_happening_with_the_cavs_this/

Why are teams facing each other twice in a row so much this season? Is this a covid thing, or was it always happening and I just never noticed it before?
Lol we have a better record than the Nets now

Curry+Wiggins > KD+Harden
 watch this video!: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQKrRyaSsMk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQKrRyaSsMk)
This sub so damn reactionary. It’s a long season and KD didn’t even play lol. They are missing a guy who some would call the best player in the world and they lost a couple of regular season games.
If the cavs play their cards right, they could make the playoffs next season.
Cavs fans are cute.
KD giving Cleveland that you beat us when down 3-1 look.
Nothing goes where it’s from Cleveland.
The gore tlou2 is perfect.
Save this thread for when nets win it all lmao
Fuck Collin Sexton

Fuck Bickerstaff

Fuck the Cavs
[deleted]
I don’t want to offend the Cavs fans here, but are the Cavs really legit after the trade?  I thought Sexton was good, but not that good. And I know Nets were playing with only 2 of the big 3 in each game, but I expected them to win both.  Someone please explain what’s happening in the NBA right now, because everything has been unpredictable with almost every team (except Detroit of course lol).
Eh lost by 12 without KD. KD plays and prob makes up for that difference. Either way it seems like the nets are throwing out new lineups every single night, might take a few weeks before it looks like it’s supposed to.
You love to see it

This cavs team is custom built to abuse this nets team
You literally just have to slightly hustle against this Nets team and you'll probably win lol
Cavs playing 5D chess getting all those inside presence.

*Jarrett Allen looks at Joe Harris*

"Y'all smell that? Smells like bbq chicken"
Drummond, Allen and Nance vs the corpse of DeAndre Jordan
Can’t wait to see how much embiid will score against this Nets
deandre jordan is not the answer
I thought i was sent through a time machine and was watching classic bigmen basketball
Now, I want to see this Nets team against Lakers. I feel like Lebron is the biggest bully ball out there. Especially on the open court.
Give Cleveland more credit in establishing some upcoming culture by telling Porter Jr. to take a hike.

A team dynamic cannot function to it's fullest if you don't send the message that malcontents are not tolerated, especially on petty things
While I agree with you that the Nets (lack of) defense is their Achilles heal, when they get into the playoffs, they have something that very few teams have: guys that can create their own shots, guys who can hit difficult shots, guys who you can run a play for and get a bucket nearly every time, guys who will live at the FT line and hit 85%+ from the stripe.

Defense be damned, they will be a tough out.
The game plan is “fuck ‘em”
The Nets started 4 guards tonight and a center with no post game. At least the Dwight Magic had Rashard Lewis to at least be another big body
"Defense doesn't win championships, don't worry it'll be fine guys. I mean for real"

-Inspirational quote from a person who didn't win a championship.
Ad is going to absolutely fucking destroy this team if we meet in the finals good god
When you have 4 centres you play bigball
People knew the nets defense and lack of interior presence was a thing. But that's just absurb. Lakers are going to stomp them with AD
Now they got Allen to pair with Drummond
Sounds like how I play 2k after a fantasy draft
And Durant might be their best defender and rim protector.

You know, the offensive load is going to be pretty well spread out, but the defensive load is just garbage the way it is right now.
Were still pissed from when we had Lebron and had the nets 1st round draft pick.. they were supposed to be the worst team ever but instead we only got the 8th pick.
Imagine trading your entire depth for one player that can score with the best of them but is lazy on defense.
I'm no coach but isn't this the key to beating the Nets? Play in the paint back down DeAndre Jordan, hope to get him in foul trouble early... Seems almost too easy especially with the Cavs depth at C and PF.
Fuck small ball that’s why they got 5 bigs.
The Nets could use a guy like Jarrett Allen
You can thank James Harden
Feasting on his old team.
And Prince for the shell of Dante exum  and late first rounder I'll never understand
Unironically the cavs won the trade.
I really love what Cleveland is doing right now. Sexton/Garland/Allen is nice.
KD and Kyrie are friends with DJ.
Bro teams with starting centers need to stop with this. Poor Jarrett Allen is a Center in a small ball league and still can’t get a starting spot. It was a dam travesty Jordan started over him
LeBron really is gonna go back to the Cavs after his contract runs out.
Teams getting emotional, harden involved
JARRETT ALLEN LOOKS LIKE THAT ONE BLACK KID WHO WAS REALLY INTO NARUTO AND I’M ALL FOR IT
I still don't understand it lol

Jarrett Allen + Prince for Dante Exum, Milwaukee pick & a second round.
Finessed your way into that deal hard.
I told all my friends as soon as the trade details came out that Jarret Allen is gonna be the stealthy best pickup of the trade. Can't believe the Nets just gave him away.
This was honestly the steal in this trade. How y'all swapped Exum for Allen I will never understand
Such a steal.
I was shocked that he was available. This cavs squad is really fun.
He's so fucking good. He's so fucking good. He's so fucking good. He's so fucking good.
TAUREAN PRINCE IS EVEN QUITE GOOD LOL
Don't underestimate the Colin Sexton effect. He is amazing. The team fits in but his energy is amazing.
Just another crime by Tilman
From the trade with harden. Happened last week I think
“I’d do it. Not gonna lie.”

He was talking about revenge.
Crazy pickup.
Yeah,  the fact they let him go was pretty mind bogging.  Nets need quality back up PFs and Cs yesterday.
Could you guys send us Javale back?
Finessed
TP has been on fire too. Drilling tres for days
Because he's a free agent and prob gonna get 20m a season.
I was so pissed. He’s been dominating this year and just taking leaps every year. He’s gonna be a very good player for you guys
I still can't believe Shamets bum ass was the reason we lost Allen. I'll never forgive Shamet for this.
Houston demanding Harden in the trade I can completely understand. Houston demanding Harden only because they could trade him for a late 2022 first is just fucking salt on the wound for Brooklyn.
East really does go through Cleveland

I WISH HE SCORED 24PTS SO THAT [THIS](https://wp.usatodaysports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2017/04/richard-sherman-mocking-darrell-revis-super-bowl.gif) WOULD BE EXTREMELY RELEVANT
Why are we seeing this meme with Cleveland?
He can't see the basket through all the trees.

It's past that point now. It's like they play for the other team trying to erase whatever lead the starter is trying to builld.
What bench? The only way they’re gonna have a decent bench is when Kyrie imagines an injury.
16/17 Thunder type bench unit, except instead of Russ you have KD, Harden, and Kyrie. There’s no excuse for losing to the Sexland Cavs back to back. You could have WNBA players coming off the bench, the big guns have to get the job done in the 36-42 minutes they’re on the court.
Dinwiddie injury is showing itself sooo much more now
That’s OK. Harden has a way with inspiring the bench and role players to buy in and give it their all.  I’m sure it’ll all work out.
They could sure use a guy like Jarrett Allen or Taurean Prince
What do you expect when you trade it all away for one player.
Ironic, the rockets have more depth
They should try to trade one of their stars for some depth. Like maybe Harden for a Allen or that guy from the Pacers
Who would win? 

Beardman and Flat Earther? 

Or 2 Sexland Bois?
Just the 4th piece is missing.
James Harden should demand a trade to an up-and-coming team like the Houston Rockets tbh. They're loaded with enough draft picks to be able to put a winning team around him imo
“I can’t win with these cats” - Kevin Durant

["When you are playing with good players, it's pretty easy" - Harden after game 1 ](https://i.imgur.com/li6iMun.jpg)
*Forces* *trade* *to* *Cavs*
Durant can't win with these cats.
“We have good pieces but it’s pretty glaring that we need a couple more pieces to complement myself” - Kyrie Irving
Last year harden would drop 40 on cavs. He is still not in form. Havent seen him like this ever. Crazy
> I know exactly what we need to do. We'll figure it out this summer
How the hell a “super” team only gonna get 29 rebounds in an NBA game with 174 shots taken?
"Look at my boy harden, he looks so happy now"
They need to get more pieces around Harden
For a sec I was like well Durant wasn’t playing, but then I remembered the team still has Harden and Kyrie lol
Honestly, my hot take is that the rockets team last season was better overall
Unfortunately they are on different conferences, how fitting it would be if HOU eliminated the Nets...
LOL... I came here to type this exact comment.
Cavs sweeping the ECF, Nets hopeless with no draft picks, just like good ol' times.
Does LeBron have the heart to beat Cleveland in the Finals?
Nothing would make me happy but almost nostalgic at the same time to see Cavs & LeBron meeting in the finals. I think it’s way more historical & dramatic than the cliché ending of LeBron being back to Cavs
we're not bad, that's for sure... defensive first team and though our offense is ranked poorly, we've been really injured this year... i think when love gets back, our offense will start shining a bit more... and our defense is already tuned up..
We are good. Not a high playoff team or anything like that but we’ve dealt with a lot of injuries and are still 8-7 with our guys getting back soon. Could be in that play-in game race.
Yes
Yeah. I think the team is better than the record suggests. We had a 2-3 week time period where our entire team was injured, including Sexton, Garland, and Love. And Love is still injured.
.500 team that’s fun. I’ll take it
Good enough to win some games we shouldn’t and annoy a bit as the last seed in the playoffs. But we’re excited
I bet they make the playoffs still probably a first round exit but playoff expeience with a team this young is invaluable honestly think it would be better if they were a lower seed and had to play the Bucks or Nets
They're a low playoff seed quality team this year. Their draft picks are finally showing their potential.
They are a legit fun team. Probably losing a lot of games in February, but one of the most enjoyable teams in the NBA this year.
Idk what you mean by legit but they’re definitely a decent team
The pandemic has made everything unpredictable but this feels sustainable. They might not finish second in drtg like they are right now but the defense is definitely for real given the pieces in place. Sexton is obviously the real deal. Despite being decimated by injuries (Okoro and Sexton missed five games, Garland missed eight games, Love has been out basically all year, list goes on), they're currently sitting at 8-7. Seems like they could not only keep this up, but improve as they heal up and get more time as a full squad.
As long as our players stay healthy we'll definitely be in the top half of eastern teams, potentially the top half of teams in the league. At this point after the big harden trade and getting Allen and Prince I'm pretty confident we will make the playoffs and depending on who we meet in the first round we could see a second round exit. That's just my personal take on things and I'm no expert, I dont foresee a historic season but have expectations of a solid one for sure.
With health and luck, they could push for the playoffs, if they wanted to. I think there might be some decisions coming that put it off a year.  I guess if the right deal came about though, maybe they do push. Maybe, Altman finds another Jarrett Allen budget move for like Collins, Lonzo, or another borderline good young starting caliber player. Maybe even a tier or two above that.
Sexton is legit. Not sure about the cavs but sexton is legit.
My question is: Drummond has been legitimately helping right? People always shit on this guy but he’s the starting center and putting up nice statlines.
young team that doesnt give up and plays defense. they will make the playoffs. definitely exciting but cant see them getting much better in the next few years.
Yes. They have a great defensive team and great frontcourt. Their frontcourt is better than most teams in the league.

The question is if Sexton and Garland and co can keep up offensively all season long
CLE has looked good by playing hard on defense when no one else is really bothering.

They're still another really good piece away from actually threatening anybody in the playoffs.
I think so. I can't believe they swooped in and managed to get Allen. Guy is a stud.
Which year?
And adding Jarrett Allen was a huge upgrade. I know he’s seen as just one of the pieces in the trade, but the nets are going to desperately wish they had kept the one guy who would make their team work 1000x better.
I haven't been so excited about a Cavs roster since LBJ left. The future is looking bright bois
[deleted]
Uh oh. Don't Aaron Gordon curse yourself
They are amazing and the NBA isn't ready for them. Especially Collins. I saw this shit coming but Collins is about to wreck people. I fucking love it. This team is built pretty well.

I'd take my team 10/10 but god compared to this team a year ago I really love the presence. This team has a clear vision and will be a threat without LeBron for the first time in a while. This team will fuck around and maybe make the playoffs.
BELIEVELAND IS REAL
As has always been the case.
TT tried to warn us
#SEXLAND
Yeah Cleveland was getting so many open looks and mismatches. Getting Drummond off the floor just to see Allen coming in is bad news for teams with no front court depth like us. Gg, Cleveland has a solid squad.
cavs were locked in like it was the playoffs.
Harden overweighted
Irving dropped 38 though
What the fuck happened to Shamet, man. He was doing well in 2019, but now it looks like he jut can't hit shots
Clippers also got back 4 straight unprotected 2nd round picks. 

That actually has value too, can help make a random acquisition.
One day Shamet’s reputation will catch up to who he really is, he’s been in a ‘slump’ for over half his career now
Shamet is a horrible fit
Just to be pedantic the nets traded their pick and we got Saddiq bey... so Another player who's already way better than Shamet.. lmao

LETS GET THIS 8 SEED ASS BABY
You guys have SexLand, of course you're all coming
Keep going. I’m almost there.
Y’all are gonna make it, higher than the 8th seed. That seed will belong to the Bulls bay beeeeeee. We land vs The Human Torch Lavine
They got their player, so why tank.
Cavs are the OKC Thunder of the east

yikes
No need to imagine.  We just witnessed it.
Your phone autocorrected “best team in NBA history” to “cavs” for some reason.
[deleted]
I just saw it live.
Kd didn’t play today tho
classic
Now you listen up right here
0-3 right?
He has, just not when he's been on another team.
Not true just ask Dion Waiters
We had a top 3 defense and then we added one of the best young defensive bigs in the game. The offense will come around now that guys are healthy and we don't have to run everything thru Drummond.
I’m going to have to watch the Cavs when they’re playing someone else. Our defense has a tendency to make every team look like the dynasty Warriors
In all fairness, the Cav's roster is like 50% centres. Somebody is going to have to guard them all.
Same weight class so why not?
I will never not upvote this. Seriously one of the funniest fucking tweets Trump EVER put out lol
Smelling like the Kobe/Nash/Dwight/Gasol Lakers.
I remember Miami's big three started off with a similar record in 2010. 2 rings confirmed??
Damn, Clippers can't even keep that title for long.
I get why people were and still are hyped. It's early days; they can and will get better. This take could age like milk, but I'd be shocked if they even made the finals without trading kyrie for role players. You can't win with 6-7 players no matter how good 3 of them are. That sentiment also leaves out chemistry issues, spacing, defensive effort, etc. There's only one ball; those 3 can't all score at once. Basketball isn't played on paper.
I love a good super team collapse.
I mean it’s not fair to judge them yet. They’ve played the Cavs
What does the word “team” mean to you?
They need to trade one of their Big 3 for solid role player defender types. 

Just watching tonight guys like Taurean Prince and Jarret Allen would be perfect fits over there, as an example
Probably have a good chance at it. There big 3 probably has the most talent of any big 3 ever. Doesn’t matter if they can’t get rebounds or play defense. Plus KD is coming back from a serious injury. They really need to be limiting his minutes if he’s their future
Judging a team 5 games in..... this sub is so reactionary
3 entitled whiny weak minded stars, 1 whom seems to mean well but is obviously mentally fucked. WCGW?
To me no, looking at their roster they had no depth and many missing pieces post harden trade.

If you have to rely on DJ reverting back to his form 7+ years ago.... you’re fucked.
2015-16 Warriors spring to mind.
called your team to exceed the expectations this year, but i wasnt thinking by this much. very impressive cohesion with your pieces
Drummond plus Picks for Kyrie lol
My dream is sending out Love, Drummond, and some picks to add more depth and a stud young PF to be the future at that position like Lauri.  Could you imagine a young core of Garland/Sexton/Okoro/Lauri/Allen with Dotson/Nance/Cedi + whoever else is brought in for more depth?
Who’s gonna pony for Drummond?
And anyone suggesting this the past week was getting downvoted and lol'd because they have 3 superstars. Yeah, it's still "too early" but I mean it doesn't take 10 games to see this. They have absolutely no depth, no defense, no rim protection, and no rebounders. That's like some of the main things a championship contender needs.
They dont play defense. They might get to the finals but the Lakers will harass them in 5
There a reason why they say “Defense wins championships” plus when was the last time, a team with a bad defense won the championship?
Sane people were ringing the alarms early even before the trade and everyone ignored the fact that although those 3 had an amazing debut together they still let the Magic score 115 on them.
It's exactly why they shouldn't be called a "title team" -- at least in their current form.
When the harden trade was first announced, there was a comment saying they are better than the Lakers and I asked how and got no reply but was down voted 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk i thought we played pretty well defensively
Okay is see your point but is it crazy to think that a team with prime KD, Harden, and Kyrie would be an elite contender? Let's give it a few more games before we cook them yeah?
People absolutely love harden now that he’s out of Houston
Yeah maybe they pickup a decent big man over the course of the season but right now if we played we'd stomp them lol.
They gotta trade Irving for some defensive role players and bench depth.
Call me crazy but I thought their opening night lineup was scarier. This current team has no defense and the only interior presence is DJs corpse
Hey the Cavs are pretty good defensively.
It would be hilarious if the Nets barely make the playoffs or even miss out.
They have the second best odds to win the title right now according to Vegas, so unless you have the Lakers in their own tier the Nets are right up there. 

And before people chime in with how Vegas is wrong, let me know when you quit your job and bet sports for a living. If Vegas lines were easy to beat, everyone would do it.
LAND
SEX
ED
I mean at this point who would you have wanted over Okoro?  Whether it was #1 overall or #5 overall seems like he was the right pick for what the Cavs want to do.
An absolute classic
Kyrie Irving is screaming in the Nets locker room and there is a bunch of arguing going on. Irving comes out say “y’all on that bullshit!” Team is imploding. Irving is in bathroom and there is still screaming coming from locker room.
goat /r/nba pasta
This will never not be funny 😂
Kyrie should be saying, “You took my number”
Pack it up boys this wins
"FOR THE SOCIETY OF FLAT EARTHERS"

I just read this after our L and this is still fucking hilarious

This pasta will never get old
Laughing so hard I just fell off the edge of the e^a^^r^^^t^^^^h
Now this is real poetry, have you considered publishing this tragic tale?
Nice plot my dud, I can't wait for the next season
Tbh I feel the ceiling is the same if not lower. That team was good enough to make the finals before the trade now it’s not as certain
A lot more more for volatility
Damn
Honestly lmao, we’re padding our net rating on Harden Kyrie and Durant this is great
Lebron and Ad for Love and Drummond, who says no!
They will win a championship before the so called “king”. 

Edit: Anyone know how to format this post to comic sans?
Watch Skip say that same thing Monday morning lol.
I hate sports talkshows.
Cleveland Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman proudly waited outside the home locker room after the final buzzer to give Collin Sexton and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Sunday afternoon. Injured forward Kevin Love yelled out, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter Dylan Windler gave a look of pleasant surprise. Guard Darius Garland yelled out, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Sexton hit the locker room door, former NBA great Kevin Durant hugged him and said, “Y’all look so different.”
Nets soar to #1 Cavs drop to #30
"ThE cAvS hAvE tHe WoRsT oFfEnSiVe RtG" - every media outlet that didn't realize we went  2 weeks without any primary ball handlers.
Honestly, anything cleveland is bad in espn's point of view
to be fair, they only played the favorites to win it all, the Cleveland cavaliers
Neva won 💀
You should add the records of teams the last couple years without him versus with
trade kyrie for westbrook you cowards
Kyrie has been our best player both games, the ball moves well enough on offense so “sharing the ball” issues people were bringing up isn’t the problem. It’s all on our putrid defense.
Cavs are back
Sex
Had me in the first half ngl
This was the second game against the Cavs..
Didn’t see the game but the news is amazing
Really makes you think why they weren't playing this type of chess during LeBron's first 7 years or in 2017 off season. Coach is definitely better and the GM seems to be good at rebuilding
The disrespect to Mo Williams. ^^^/s
He plays both ends...and passes!
Best Cavs guard ever (respect to Mark Price)
Two words: Grit. And Grind.
They seriously better hope they don't get a 1st round matchup against Indiana
I feel like they'd be fine without Kyrie
KD could probably carry them out of the 1st round
Shit depth is the reason they're losing, not their big 3.
Only if it’s KD, I think.

If it’s either Kyrie or Harden, they’d still go deep.
I think that’s a stretch depending on the seeding, but the point still stands that this team has no depth.
Only if its KD
Yeah against the cavs
That's the thing though. They are 200% offense and 0% defence lol. Defensively they are a sieve on the interior with washed DJ and obviously Kyrie and Harden can't defend for shit
Which should 100% be a concern for KD's Achilles considering the way they're gonna have to play him.
Every big three in recent history has had one as a  big man who can rebound and anchor the defense. The nets don’t have that.
>Honestly though it made me think how insane LeBron in 2018 was, missing 2 of the 3 main pieces. Just ridiculous.

For real it really puts into perspective how far ahead of the competition LeBron is. He carried that team to 50 wins & the freaking finals ffs. He's seriously so much better than everyone else it's not even close
Trade Kylie for Porzingis & Boban for peak verticality
they aren't trading kyrie because kyrie is their first option
Maybe there's still room for the nets to get a 3rd option like Donovan Mitchell when one of the big 3 go down
Couldn't have said it better.
It typically takes a year to fill out the roster, see all three times LeBron switched teams. You start with the studs, then you can add role players over the next year. Real complicated idea.
Literally what happened to the Knicks in the Melo trade too.
Exactly
Of the Cavs
Of course, the Nets gave prime Sexton Jarrett Allen and Taurean Prince. Lakers are literally drawing dead against the Cavs
The play Bam tomorrow lol.
As could I.
You mis-typed "4".
Mike Brown’s 1st LeBron Cavs were great defensively.
Did you start watching the Cavs in 2018?
>pretty much my entire life 

Uh. How old are you?
Who the fuck taught this baby to type?
How old are you lol
Grit and Grind Cavs let’s fucking go
You missed the late 90s Mike Fratello teams where we held teams to 88-89 points per game.  We were only scoring 90 ourselves so it was the only way to win.
Are you five years old?
2015 Cavs were pretty nice defensively - that was Blatt's strength. And that defense was how the Cavs made it a series despite Love and Kyrie going down.
You start watching 5 years ago?
2015 cavs under Blatt has entered the chat
He should make an all rookie team for defense alone. But they only look at stats sadly
they said he'd be a great defensive player and he's been in the league for like 2 weeks and can already shut off guys like Harden to the basket.

Pretty incredible.
As an Auburn man, it makes me so happy to see our first one-and-done doing so well in the league. And also sad. I miss him
Herro
duhhhhh
They're screwed in a 7 game series.
Cause its true
I wonder if they can trade Kyrie for a quality big.
Did he really play so bad in Phoenix that he couldn’t even get minutes for this Depleted nets team? He was balling out for Miami not even that long ago, and starting over DWade.
free methcurry
Cleveland sports looking good if you ignore the Indians
Kinda reminds me of the 2018 Cavs, where they could score well but couldn't defend at all
Tbf... Most of us did as well.
He's still out of shape
The offensive system is not centered/built around him anymore. Could explain lesser production. 

Plus Kyrie.
Kyrie throws him off his game i guess?

I dunno he seemed like a star before

Now? I dunno
"We're just not good enough" - James Harden
He’s having to adjust to sharing the offensive load. Also fat
I’ve got my popcorn ready for the nets to completely come unglued investing in the artist and the selfish kid who takes the ball and goes home when he doesn’t get his way. KD is the only man out of their big 3.
https://www.instagram.com/p/CKSnv8CHHuL/?igshid=y2cqnfdlxshl
Yes as opposed to /r/nba's favourite player James Harden
Some absolute spanner said that Kyrie is the problem because he's not distributing enough to Harden and KD who are "better scorers"... even though they're better scorers, he's been the best scorer over the past two games so why the fuck does it matter? He's shooting 55%, harden went 6-14 both games. The "better scorer" is whoever shot the most efficient and scored the most.
He’s a straight up bum anywhere outside the offensive zone. Harden and Kyrie deserve each other.
I mean... Kyrie would've been locked down harder and Harden would've gone off even more, plus getting the rest of the team involved...
He came in fat and lazy, and now he's still fat and lazy. It's not a switch you can just flip. The weight loss industry is gigantic (no pun intended) because it's so hard, especially as you get older. 

At 31, sure he can work back into shape, but it will take awhile and we're also talking NBA shape here. Even if he had been in top shape he'd still have declined with age. People claim Harden will age gracefully, but only people with great work ethics age well.
Harden almost always LOOKS lazy, regardless of the actual effort he’s putting in.
I dont know , maybe doesn't get along with kyrie?

Without him, he was balling. The offense looked damn good, sure their defense was bad.
celtics flair saying this is the most surprising shit ive seen all week
The only player on our team that shouldn't be ashamed of his performance.
Something something too many shots
a solid -18 for him tonight.  He had a negative point diff during his cavs/lebron era too.  The simple fact is, you're playing 4v5 on defense when he's on the floor.
Well he did take the majority of shots in the double OT loss cause he wants to be the man. If you wanna be the man you’re going to get put under the microscope.
He does zero for his team outside of scoring. He doesn't facilitate and he doesn't play defense. He's not the reason they lost to us, but his numbers make him look like he played much better than he actually did
He has had great shooting nights, but that doesn’t excuse him from not running back on defence. He’s a leader and should be setting the tone for the team.
To be fair, he is also a turnstile on defense. We both should know.
Love the old box score fallacy
He’s terrible on defense though
How many points has he given up?
He has given up 67 points and an extra 6 assists to Colin Sexton I would think that shows he was out played that’s an issue might not be the only one but still an issue
I hope you understand that having a lot of points doesn’t necessarily mean a whole lot when your time still got out scored...
Two comments beneath you
Yeah if anything the last two losses are more of Harden than Irving. Some of his turnovers are horrendous
And -11 this game.
Problem is you need all three guys to get 30+ to have a chance to win with how bad their bench is.
he's literally the nets first option and no one is aware of it
Defense + bench like most people suspected.
Well he’s an artist
He has a nimbleness to him, but he can get out of control in a hurry.
There is no way the Nets make it to the Finals like this. We're a 2nd round out at best, unless we really start stepping up.
problem is finding someone that wants him
Why move him?
But actually athletic though. Love to see it.
Imagine if they had Allen and Lavert???
They could also use someone like an entire NBA bench
I  started watching a year or two before "the shot." This team is sizing up to be as fun as that team. If only we didn't trade Harper : (
Scored 20+ points in every single game so far this season. Continuing where he left off since last year’s post-Allstar break.
And they traded him for one of the easiest guys to root against.
Yah, that first double ot game motivates me to specifically watch Nets games in hopes that they lose. Who thought hating on this flawed super team could bring such joy. 😃🙃
Haha enjoy winning while you can man! You’ve got a sick young squad; they’re going to develop right in front of your eyes and it’ll be a beauty to watch.
Eh. You just need to build the right team with him. He was lethal with us and Lebron.
Doesn't matter how much Kyrie wants to score when he let's any player walk right by him on defense.
Kyrie would rather drop 40 in a loss and say he played well and my team mates didn’t step up, then drop 20 and have the team win if someone or multiple other players on the team out scored him.
These games have not been kyries fault.
That’s why Steph over Kyrie anyway of the week
They should trade kyrie for two solid players and pick up a ring chaser, they'll be good then.  Kyrie ain't winning shit
Yeah I think its true, I dont want to kyrie bash, but the Nets were playing decent before he joined.

Now their offense doesn't look great , at least tonight.
Kyrie doesnt allow Harden to do anything
My man scored 38 but cmon get your best player involved in the game
On top of that...top 5 worst pg defender
All thanks to the Nets pick.
*Clanks*
This
Eh they should be worried but it is a small sample. Some games they will just overwhelm, especially when there's at least some chemistry. But they won't be auto Champs
Damn you are right small sample sizes are super reliable
It's still a small sample size and they I'll be trying to get some reps to get some chemistry. But it is hard seeing them get put of the east of they have 0 defense be it perimeter or rim protecting bc no championship team wins without it. Still see them egt to Atleast the ecf
Allen is so dynamic...
Unfortunately...he will likely be banged up by then
Not if Durant gets injured first trying to put the entire team on his back.
You mean traded.
But it being in the most Cleveland fashion of when fans can't really attend games...
I feel like now is not the time to criticize someone who has averaged 37.5 points in the 2 games theyve played together on 55% shooting. But thats just me.
are you really trying to blame Kyrie for this loss lmao, maybe watch the game before commenting, Harden has been passive asf and their defense is why they are losing
lol what kind of garbage take is this. Were we watching the same games? Harden couldn't look less interested in being out there if he tried. Kyrie is the only thing that kept them in these games.
harden will be in the chris bosh role, kyrie is letting it be known hes not gonna be the one taking a backseat in these first two games
Eh I’d wait to see how Kyrie plays when his meter isn’t running hot. He’s been on fire these last two games so I’m fine with him shooting thus far. If this happens on a night when Harden has it going and Kyrie is cold then it’s something to be worried about
[deleted]
Kd would be pissed
Lowry for Irving
R u dumb
Dropped almost 40 both games yeah he’s definitely worse and needs to be traded
If you watched the games you woukd see he is better at everything atm than Harden though.
Harden had penty of opportunities to score and teke over  he just didn't. It's not Kyrie's fault at all.
Ky was the only good thing about the Nets tonight.
Harden slowed down the game and is turnover orone, their defense was shit and shooters didn't hit their shots.
Dumb place to post this, it wasn’t even the 3 of them today.
Spicy af
I'm a casual, could u please explain to me how come they played against each other once again so quickly..thx
They tried to go small, Cleveland said screw your small ball here's Prince, Nance, and Allen.  GL
Just Kyrie and Harden together is not a great matchmaker. I don't think it will work well long terms and this will probably fall apart at the end of the season. 

Kyrie wants to be the guy (batman), but in reality, he's a robin to a batman. 

Harden is the same, he wants to take control of the offense and score, but he is not going to fully commit to the defense because of his size and athletic/ability. 

There are going to be friction down the road and most likely right before the trade deadline. On top of that, there is a serious need on the bench, and trying to stagger minutes with Harden and Kyrie, well you might as well just have all three play 48 min each games.
2-0 with Durant/Harden, no Irving

0-2 with Irving/Harden, regardless of Durant
lmao
Harden: “My job here is done.”

Nets: “But you haven’t even done anything.”

Harden: “Exactly.”
There was a possession where the Cavs had like 5 offensive rebounds lolo
Haha it was never going to work out. No one can name one championship team that had horrible defense because it’s an impossible feat. The nets need to acquire some depth, and they need to do so quickly.
Was about to be a RFA so likely to get 15-20/yr and they had nothing else worthwhile that teams would've given assets for in the Harden trade.  They should've kept all their role players and sent out Kyrie.  Would've been a better team.
Funny thing was that he had 37 then 38 but made Sexton look like prime Curry last game and prime CP3 this game.
The clippers didn’t implode this early in the season
His eyes got big for KD. Cant fail in the playoffs if you got the Finals MVP on your team. But knowing Harden's luck, KD gets injured in the playoffs and they lose.
Now imagine just ONE injury
yes
We are pretty good and deep too. Nance and Cedi. Improved a lot.
Maybe and yes.
Brons coming home?
They had a great bench, and then they traded most of it for James Harden.
Yup
They were 30th offensively before playing yall lmao
Those rankings weren’t accurate to the team that played the last 2 games. A lot of guys were injured when they got put there
Yeah, I kind of want to take a half step back to make 2 steps toward this summer. One more lottery chance in a stacked draft and assets for Drummond and possibly Love.
So condescending holy shit lol
>Still a way to go before you're a serious threat

Shouldn't you not be talking down after dropping two games in a row against the same guys? lol
But no Lebron
With ten times worse defense
They have a b2b tom and coming from a 2 OT game
He's a better defender than Kyrie and Harden put together.
They should never listen to Skip. He mentioned about Jordan being an all defensive first team 3-4 yrs ago. Lol
[deleted]
He couldn’t miss!
Their offense isn’t the problem so far
Load management. They have a b2b
Dodging the Cavs
Load management
Didn't the Cavs beat the 76ers early on as well?
Embiid gonna drop 60.
Super Sayain
Some people think the Nets are the Clippers of New York.
They sure as hell didn't give that 2010 Heat team any time to "gel"
The thing I’m gonna nut so much
No one cares
It's the former. Playing baseball-style series to reduce travel and make contact tracing easier.
it's a covid thing, it reduces the amount the teams have to travel
They lost against the Cavs with KD too...
They're gonna make it this year.
Why wait a year?
Yeah fucking right
Fuck you
go watch Power Rangers buddy
Fuck Kyrie, ain’t done shit since he forced his way out of Cleveland
Not if they play the 8th seed Cavaliers in round 1
The Cavs were a playoff contender before the trade just dealing with the majority of their starters/high depth players injured.  The trade provided additional quality depth and the Center of the future in Allen which made them even better.  Also the Nets did have all 3 for the first game...
They lost on Wednesday with kd it was OT
I hope we get a first round matchup with the Nets in the playoffs
They have the goat net's pick it's inevitable.
If the Cavs and Nets meet in the playoffs it would be a massive beatdown lol. It wouldn't be close. Don't be rope-a-doped lol. KD can drop 40 whenever he wants and its over before it starts.
Accurate.

These Nets will fold harder than the Clippers.
At the beginning of the year, I was talking about how the nets shipping off their young assets to create a Harden, Kyrie, Durant combo would be the perfect team to end up a 5th seed (at best) that got bounced in the first round in the playoffs. And everyone here laughed at me!

It’s just such an obviously lopsided team, man. None of those dudes play any kind of defense. Not to mention that I’ve been watching Kyrie ruin team chemistry with his weird ass personality since he thought he’d have a better chance to win WITHOUT the best player on the planet in his team.
KD didn't play today and last game Sexton just went God mode. Your comment is an overreaction.
[happy Simmons noises]
This sounds like a very early take that could still age poorly
I think they added OREB & TREB in the chart above, instead of just using the Total
https://statsdmz.nba.com/pdfs/20210122/20210122_BKNCLE.pdf


I included the team rebounds.  The box score only shows individual rebounds.
Duuuuuuude.
KD does a decent job at defending him but if he switches on to literally anyone else they aren’t stopping him 1 single time. After that he’ll start dropping 3s and it will be game
Wasnt gortat his backup?
No he isn’t. AD plays on the perimeter too much. LeBron, Dennis and Harrell will eat. AD will feast on the boards and with second chance
Thanks James!
I mean, it’s about time we benefited from a super team forming instead of getting massively screwed
The Rockets send their regards.
Now now, you can also thank Kyrie for going AWOL and making the Nets sell the farm for "Kyrie's mental health" insurance.
Let’s not carried away here
how they give up levert and allen is mind blogging
He scored as many points as Harden lol
That dunk on Joe Harris... I feel like maybe he was taking something out on him there. Still owes him for takeout or something.
I understand that the Rockets didn’t really need Jarrett Allen because Christian Wood is so good for them. But they definitely could’ve gotten more for him than Exum+ 2022 Bucks pick. Not much of a return for a very good young center.
It’s really just a swap of bad contracts (prince/exum) and then Allen’s restricted rights in exchange for a first. Maybe prince’s contract has a little excess value in relation to exum’s. So you guys got that little excess plus the right to pay Allen. A late first seems like a pretty reasonable price for that, imo.
He was a salary dump! How good would he look on their second unit right now?
They straight up slid into this trade and made out like bandits
[deleted]
Who did they give up?  Seriously asking
Even at the time it looked like they'd easily won the trade. Arguably everyone got what they wanted out of it.
Cavs completely feasted on the mf basket
Every team won IMO
That was my first thought when I read the trade to begin with. Houston did pretty well too. Nets, we'll see in the long run. Oladipo demanding a trade from the team that made him a star kinda fucked the Pacers and I hope he sucks in Houston.
and our boy Nance!! 

He's such a great dude and great player. We love him here
Me too, such a fun team to watch so far this season!
Expect Drummond to be traded
The dream lol
would actually be a super nice fit around him.

Solid athletic bigs that can run the floor and defend, Garland who can pass and kinda shoot, and Sexton who can create his own shot.

The Re2urn!!!
How many years does he have left in la. I actually always assumed his plan was to leave, let them rebuild, come back and exhaust assets in a run, leave and let them rebuild, then come back for a final run and end his career here
Deal. Javale and Love for Kuz
“Always has been” 🌎👩‍🚀🔫👩‍🚀
Tristan was right all along
Last Eastern Conference team to beat the Cavs in the playoffs was the 2010 Celtics.
Cavs superteam crushing the sorry Nets as usual
haven't heard THAT before.
Damn straight
TT tried to warn us
“He’s hiding for a reason” lol
Lol LaMelo is just a fun guy
Lol I thought it was gonna be the “It smell like bitch in here” meme
I don’t know who all those other guys are, but the dude in the red T-shirt is obviously Philadelphia.
I would be so into that
Honestly y'all Knicks fans need a W, I'm for it
but who's taking about you?
CLE not Cleveland! (Fans of Toronto rap may get that reference)
 I CHANGED IT
Sexton sucks. He's an average player whose scoring average is propped up by this soft no-defense NBA

20 years ago, he'd averaging 8 PPG
Yea dropped 38 with his eyes closed.
That reminds me of Nuggets 4 guard bench lol
> It's past that point now. It's like they play for the other team 

bro im dead lmao
Prince levert and Allen are sorely missed. Does having harden make up for the lost depth?
Its like a bunch of snakes..
/r/rareinsults
i mean if they have KD tonight they probably win but it kinda shows how if any of the big 3 are injured for the playoffs they are screwed
The team that gets all of the Nets picks
I do believe theyre just referred to as "Sexland", sir.
Whoa whoa whoa. They’re Sexland Mans
Please let it be Westbrook.
LMAO!!!
[Kyrie](https://youtu.be/V16hz0c8Nl0) already told you all that Nets need more pieces
All they need is a rebounder/defender/rim-protector who can clone himself to fill out a second unit replete with shooting and ball-handling and they’re all set.
They asked Iverson to come out of retirement, but he refused because the nets don’t play D or practice hard enough.
I see what you did there.  We don't want him back!
Harden for wall straight up, who says no?
"The young guys don't know what it takes to be a championship level team," Irving said, via Keith Smith of Real GM. "What it takes every day. And if they think it is hard now, what do they think it will be like when we're trying to get to the Finals?"
Kyrie destroyed beautiful Nets basketball
"Curry can't carry a team like Harden or KD" -/r/nba
Westbrook: "You couldn't live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me."
kyrie already isolating himself from the team!! /s
Harden hangs with the hottest takes.
:c
lmao kyrie looks quite unfazed
He got fat out of shape.
This isn’t being talked about enough. He was invisible for stretches this game, not the one-man offense we’re used to.
Yeah he looks like shit this season. Reminds me when he had that super long bad stretch last season.
Dare I say: did we win the trade? /s
He's not in shape and his hair is a mess.
One washed DeAndre Jordan as your only real center and no Kevin Durant.
We're coming for you Toronto.
Idk if your offense would improve with Love back, but I do know he'd hurt your defense. If I were Cleveland I would try to trade him before he gets back on the floor. I can only imagine his value goes down after that
I don’t want Love back. He will hurt this team
Defense first with a poorly ranked offense? Oh God that's my favorite
I don't think Love should even start.
Can't wait to see Love back. He can bring the offense to next level
[deleted]
Username checks out
CEEEEEEEDDIIIIIIIIIII
Love has played like 3 min all year haha
He’s our center of the future and a cornerstone. He matches up so well with Sexton and Garland. If Okoro can ever get a consistent jumper this team will be dangerous.
[deleted]
And they tried keeping him and offering Shamat but no one wants him and he's been playing awful for us. A real shame
And the chances of other teams winning drastic go down
Total clown move trading him. The Rockets really weren’t gonna do the trade without the 28th or so pick in the 2022 draft? Come on
Jarrett Allen has always been really good BUT he feasted more on this team because they couldn't defend for shit.
I'm super high on Jarrett Allen, have been for a while. I can't believe the Cavs flipped the *Bucks pick* for him AFTER GIANNIS RE-SIGNED.

Houston fleecing the Nets FOR them, apparently, just insisting on that one extra FRP.
He was the only competent center on the Nets - will be amazed if they don't have a plan to add depth as they'll get abused inside by good centers.
I couldn't believe they parted with Allen.
He’s a monster.
I’m hoping this team will surpass the fat Shawn Kemp years as the best Non-LeBron Cavs team of my life.
People say this like LBJ's been gone for the last 15 years lol
You deserve it. Kid fucking turned it around big time. He's a scoring monster. 

You're a good team.
Lyndon left office in 1968... guess Cleveland fans have suffered a while
When Allen went despicable on his old team with that dunk, I got them 2016 feels
So like...not that long ago? Lol
How about before LBJ was ever with you guys?
I would never, ever, EVER stop telling the story to anyone who would listen if these Cavs beat the Lakers in the finals this season.
So two whole seasons?
Haven’t paid attention since lbj left. Seems like we’re out of the post lbj hole. Am excited.
Honestly looking at ur roster. Pretty much everyone in rotation would be a starter or solid bench piece on other playoff teams. Sexton is really good but something about garland excites me more.
2401
Very much agree. I also cringe whenever Reggie Perry comes on. I don’t think it’s an overreaction to say he’s the worst rotation player in the league.
Having at least one is Nance and Allen on the court the entire game must be a nightmare for opposing front courts. Two of the top hustle guys out there.
Mom's speghetti?
[deleted]
And played his usual quality of defense to give it all back.

Both ends of a basketball court matter.
he somehow peaked his rookie year and went downhill year after year
I'm not able to watch games. Does he still move as well as he used to back in 2019? I remember him being directly mentored by JJ Redick so he was doing the same things JJ does -- sprinting off the ball for catch and shoot 3's -- and was burning teams with it.
Embiid makes shooters look so much better because of his gravity in the post.  Shamet doesn’t have that anymore
I remember us Sixers fans were so upset when we traded him because he was like JJ Reddick 2.0 with us but then he fell off a cliff hard. Shame, I like the guy :/
He lost his JJ Reddick 🙁
His head is throwing off his shooting balance.
All for Shamet? Sheesh
Brett Brown really got the best out of him
yeah why the hell did the Nets think they needed another guy who doesn't play defence?
9 is still better than dnp-cd
better than whatever the hell shamet is doing
$16 mill/ year tho
Duhhh. But are they the best in history tho???
I wonder how long that’ll hold. I say it’s about 50/50 this year, whether the Lakers or whoever emerges in the West, beat the East champs. So many stacked teams in the top 5 East seeds.
Bubble Suns a close 2nd
>No

Yes
Bro it's people like you who give Lakers fan a bad name
Way to ruin a good comment chain
Yes
Haven’t made the playoffs without LeBron since 1998
Think they meant covid. As in assuming there's actually a playoffs lol
Some might even say We Are All Witnesses.
His phone is from 2029. Buckle up, buckaroo
It definitely could be like that, but at the same time I do think the complete lack of capable defenders on this Net’s team is notable.
I think you’re underestimating the good role players that Heat team had. Mike Miller, Eddie House, Mike Bibby, and Udonis Haslem were good vet players to have coming off the bench.
he didnt play bc he played 50 minutes in their last game, which they also lost
thats why we won in regulation instead of ot again
As far as I can remember yes.
Holy shit so the last time he played us before this series was his Celtics debut? That's nuts
Collin "Nets pick" Sexton living rent free in Kyrie's head once again
Wat?
This game was pretty bad. Game 1 cavs were just shooting out of their minds.  The interior defense is a huge problem.  Like Jordan is getting ate down there with no help.
Dynasty warriors lol man
Tiny backcourt and L A R G E frontcourt balances out to a normal roster, right?
That was a nasty line by you
Politics isn't my bag, but I love the video of him claiming victory after the first day of counting votes. He claimed victory in some of the states that he ended up losing lol
My vote goes to the tweet where he basically said “we hereby claim Georgia as a victory” or something like that. He tried to simply claim the states lol
Still can't believe a clown like him got elected as the president...
I have to say, his best 2 tweets for me are the one wishing a happy September 11 to all, “even the haters and losers” & the one where he talked about Kristen Stewart cheating on Robert Pattinson “like a dog” and telling Rob to break up with her.
Legitimately, had some random person on Facebook said that, everyone would assume that he was an idiot.
Gotta be up there with the "Doesn't matter, I'll still keep drinking that garbage" tweet about Diet Coke
His IQ is one of the highest, after all.
This is gonna be fun.
That team wasn’t healthy it’s not even close to these dudes in their primes
I see this team, and I still think it's the Kobe/Shaq/Malone/Payton Lakers.
Now this is going to be fun...not!
Harden and Durant and Kyrie are easily the top 10 players in the game right now. And in their prime.

Nash was old, Gasol was fading and had injury issues and Dwight only averaged 17 pts that season.

The only player that I would consider a top 10 player on the Lakers roster that season would be Kobe.

It's not the same at all.
Don't forget our defensive stopper MWP
Don’t forget the Gary Payton/Karl Malone/Kobe/Shaq version of the band 😁
Or the Shaq/Kobe/Malone/Payton squad
This easy. I still remember that July 4th when the deals were announced bleacher report did like a thanks for killing the nba season montage ... joke was on us. 

Mike Dantoni was the abject wrong coach for that squad. We’ll always wonder what Phil would have done
That Lakers squad or those 73-9 Warriors.
[deleted]
Kyrie for Jared Allen. Who would say no?
We will add TT and Shump, but no Nets pick
As awesome as that'd be, it'd be so hard to keep a core like that together very long.  They'd get some crazy contract offers from other teams after being starters and putting up big numbers for us.  We've seen more and more often young guys get massive contract offers from teams based on their "potential".
Nobody. Pistons barely traded him last year for a 2nd rounder.
They're the 2011 Heat with worse defense.
After the Harden trade I checked out the rosters for the last 10 years of champion teams. Pretty much every single one of them has a DPOY. Some of them have multiple.
According to Nets GM, the roster is still going to change and they have 2 additional roster spots available for trade/buyout market. 

I think this new roster is going to need at least 15-20 games to bring it together. Its clear that Kyrie definitely needs to take a step back.
I got downvoted when I said that about the Wizards and Hawks before the season. Feel like this sub as a whole massively underrate defense and think you can just outscore every team.
I'd have to think Nets stans are banking on them acquiring a defense in mid-season trades or this offseason.  NGL it's looking shaky right now.
The 2011 heat had 3 stars but all 3 of them were fantastic defenders. Bosh was always great defensively and at the time Bron and Wade were probably the best defenders at their positions. This nets team has 3 stars but 2 of them dont play D and while KD isnt bad, he cant be the teams number 1 defender especially coming off the achilles
and with 3 max players next year they wont be able to get any real impact signings other than vet min ring chasers and an MLE. Not good.

Having 3 superstars is one thing. Having 3 max contract superstars.. not good
They need to trade Kyrie for a legit big
Who on this team is stopping Giannis and/or Embiid in a seven game series? Throw in Sabonis & Turner too. That’s three other east teams right there. Nets need to get better at defense or they aren’t sniffing the finals.
Finals? If they get matched against Cleveland in the playoffs, they might not even get that far.
Well if they manage to get to the Finals, clearly they figured something out. East isn't exactly free just because Lebron isn't there anymore.
01 Lakers. Literally ever team since has been top 12
lol cant really get mad, this sub is super reactionary. kyrie, harden, kd is super talented, but everyone knew the fit was gonna be awkward + their depth and surrounding talent is weak af. they have 0 rim protection. since the harden trade ive been watching almost all their games, deandre jordan fucking sucks. theres plenty of bigs rotting on benches around the league that can fill his role better than he does
The threads after their wins against Magic and Bucks (both wins not convincing) were even more hilarious. People guaranteeing them a finals spot and even a ring. Reminds me heavily of the Clippers fanboys last season, people bandwagoned this Nets team prematurely despite all the red flags.
Vegas is entirely based off where people are putting their money. This doesn't mean they are actually a top tier team.
You got it from me, girl.
Ooooh not that they robbed us in the draft (Okoro is a baller) but that they robbed us not inviting us to the bubble when we werent mathematically eliminated (still no realistic shot of making it though haha)
[deleted]
Drake Senpai is coming to give bench depth.
Does anyone have the link to the original? I’ve seen it in different formats but I’d like to know where it came from.
This version may not be a pasta for long this season
Wasn't this a Simpsons joke first?
Anytime you add the superstar, your ceiling gets higher. Don’t just look at this year but next year
They just gotta get rid of Kyrie.
The cavs
Copy and paste? No clue
I don't want to overreact, but this is the best Cavs team I've ever seen
Nobody stands a chance against SexManLand
Yup. Kyrie easily scored in the 4th. Then cavs just keeps on answering also with easy buckets or trip to ft line
I know I could google it but, whos coaching? They’re doing a fucking phenomenal job
Someone tell him, please.
Is this a /r/woosh?
There is probably a lot to unpack there. 

During LeBron’s first run, the first GM was Jim Paxson. He is as bad as his brother. In 2004, the Cavs had the number 10 pick. Instead of drafting Jameer Nelson, whom every mock in the world had the Cavs taking, he selected Luke Jackson because he “fell” to the Cavs. 

In LeBron’s second year, Paxson traded the Cavs first round pick for Marko Jaric. He played half of a season for the Cavs before being shipped out for a second round pick. 

So, Paxon used the only two lottery picks had during LeBrons run with the Cavs on Luke Jackson and half a season of Marko Jaric. Let that sink in. 

Dan Gilbert buys the team. Paxson is fired and Danny Ferry is hired. Ferry immediately moves into a championship or bust mode, giving Larry Hughes a max deal and signing Donyell Marshall and Damon Jones to long term deals. He also ships picks out an alarming rate. Over the remaining five years, the Cavs make three first round selections: Shannon Brown, Christian Eyenga, and JJ Hickson. Second round picks are constantly shipped out during roster re-shuffling moves. 

So basically, the Cavs strip-mined their assets in a desperate attempt to make the Cavs a championship team and didn’t work. They never made moves to make the team better in two or three years. It was always “make the team better this instant!”

In 2014, when LeBron returned, you would have thought the Cavs would have learned their lesson. They had a ton of picks from the bad years between LeBron and a ton of cap space. They immediately strip mined again over 2015 and 2016 to bring in Mozgov, Shumpert, Smith and Frye. At the end of the day they won a title, but I think that had showed Griffin had a better idea of what talent was than Ferry and LeBron is just that good. But it was the same mentality: improve the team for the current season at all costs. 

I think a couple of things have changed during this rebuild. As much as I hate to say it like this, Dan Gilbert having a stroke probably freed the front office to operate with a long-term plan. Gilbert is no longer involved with the day to day operations, and there is probably no one pushing for the Cavs to win right this instant. As such, the front office can make moves with flexibility for the future in mind (E.g., trading for a pair of Milwaukee first rounders but holding them until a great opportunity like Allen pops up). 

TL;DR is the Cavs tried every year to win a title to appease LeBron and satisfy Dan Gilbert. Now that both are out of the way, the front office can just actually plan two to three years out and it’s showing.

Edit: Jiri Welsch, not Marco Jaric. I mix up my pre-2010 Eastern Europeans.
Honestly I think Koby was just flustered because as soon as he came in, kyrie was like, "nah, I'm out"
Mo, Lebron, and JJ Hickson were the original Big 3.
You mean flip murray
Cavs were low key amazing at drafting PGs in the late 80’s and 90’s. Price (draft day trade w/ Dallas), Ron Harper, Kevin Johnson, Terrell Brandon, Brevin Knight, Andre Miller.
Sabonis will feast!
I can easily see it to.

Philly/bucks/Boston for 1-3, nets 4, pacers 5 for example (any order 1-3&4&5). This isn’t some crazy thought.
or Philly

or Cleveland

...
Imagine if they trade Kyrie for WB
I think they’re better without Kyrie
Y’all are wilding. He’s scored almost 40 point twice on 55 FG the last 2 games. Their issue is interior defence far more than (their also shoddy) perimeter defence.
Harden/KD two man game looks nice. Kyrie cant carry a team tho. Especially if Harden continues being fat.
If I was the Nets, I would look at the possibility of trying to move either Harden or preferably Kyrie for some aggressive athletic center. He doesn't have to be super talented just big and tough. Obviously that would come with other parts because in spite of how they currently look the three of them are real talented.

Obviously you keep Durant because alongside being an excellent offensive talent he plays real D.
Problem is next man up now has to play major minutes, as does his backup and for a team with no depth already, that could be a death sentence
100%. They should trade Kyrie for some actual role players. Harden and KD have all the talent to carry the team. Maybe they could get a player like Jarett Allen or something
I feel like you guys are not watching. Kyrie ain't the problem. James Harden is in some kind of funk...
Depends on who they play
Only if he plays the 5 on defense
This statement is precisely why KD will never reach LeBron's level.
I wouldn't count on that, after his injury I doubt he would go that hard for just get to the 2nd round
Shit depth and garbage defense
Yeah he’s saying if the Big three is not intact on top of their shit depth, they’re out of luck.
Exactly what he said essentially
They have shit depth because of the big 3
nah it’s the lack of good bigs. DeAndre Jordon is bad at everything and can’t defend to save his life anymore.
That was the trade off.
The big 3 should be enough to carry them no excuses even if one goes down they still have two stars
And the buyout market is never good enough to build an entire depth chart out of. At best they can get someone the caliber of MKG, but they really need to get on the phones and make some more moves.
And two of their top 3 dont defend. The Heatles all played D
Durant needs to put on like 30kg of mass and boom spider center
Dallas wouldn’t take kyrie if he waved his salary
Except this Nets team doesn’t have the luxury of time
Okay but that's not what happened w/ Lebron to the Lakers. They were denied Davis in LeBron's first year, waited till the off-season, and then got him at a more reasonable price. If the Nets are fine not winning this year (or are fine at least rolling the dice with KI & KD and a real team), why not make the trade during the off-season (for Harden or another 3rd star), when the cost isn't so constraining that it sets a limit on short-term championship equity, the very thing you're presumably trying to maximize?
That should be fun for them
So? You act like we don't also have a great frontcourt. Drummond, Allen, and McGee will be blocking everything.
Yea for real. I guess a lot of this sub is too young to remember lol
I hated those Cavs. So hard to score against.
really like 2003 lol
Can we interest you in a Contract Year Drummond?
He played well in the bubble as well. At this point he's absolutely an upgrade over Shamet who is just complete trash right now
Don't sleep on the Indians either.  They're not WS contenders, but they're still going to have elite pitching.  IF they can get any sort of production out of their lineup, they will make noise.
'they' is a weird way to spell 'LeBron'
I’m guilty of this as well! Aside from how imprsssive the young core has looked thus far, the coaching has been brilliant. I’m so pleasantly surprised by how effective JB Bickerstaff’s schemes are.
He's in shape. Round is a shape.
[deleted]
At the Rockets it was all Harden.  I don't know if he's ready to only put up 20 points per game.  I think he'll tire of it.
I never said that though. Just that r/NBA dislikes Kyrie more.
Yeah, if the defense is giving it to him, he has to take it. The great thing about having Durant and Harden is that Kyrie all of a sudden isn’t getting the defenses attention the same way. Defenses give it to Kyrie. He has to take it because it’s ultra efficient offense.
Harden's such a weird sort of player - his skill set shows that he works seriously hard, but it's like he only works on the things he enjoys doing and gets lazy with the stuff he doesn't like. He's got the physical gifts to have defensive skills like Iguodala did - crazy quick hands and great timing, but he's never ever put in the work to build the quality defensive tool kit that would unlock that.

Durant looks like he might be the Nets best defensive player.
Great athletes don't let themselves get fat and lazy ~ except for maybe Joey Chestnut.
Too many cooks
You are more articulate than most
He did that for us a lot too. We'd lose a game and think Kyrie had a trash game just from watching it. Check the box score and he scored ~30 with great efficiency. Something doesn't add up, but I've never been able to figure out what. When Tatum has a good game you know it and there's a very good chance we won the game, but it wasn't like that with Kyrie. Of course people are going to think I'm just bitter, but whatever. Kyrie is a magician with the ball, but something about his game doesn't translate to wins like you'd expect.
Kyrie has been the only thing keeping them in these games.
stop it. these past 2 losses have not been his fault he’s been on fire
lol fr. kyrie spends way way waaay too much time hunting his shot in the midrange. its not an efficient playstlyle at all. hes playing like an overglorified cj mccollum rn, which isnt what you want outta kyrie at all
That’s awful lol. If he is then they’re horribly misusing two of the most prolific and efficient scorers of all time
Kyrie, Harden, Durant. All have big egos, with Durant having significantly less out of the three.

Hear me out, Kyrie and Harden are locker room killers. Who knows how toxic it will get or if it will even get toxic. Honestly, who knows maybe they'll be super focused on the chip and put in the work.

Then there's the bench issue. No depth whatsoever. With DinWiddie gone, it's looking bad for the second unit. An injury to one of the big 3 will also spoil things if it does happen. 

Most likely they will play 40+ mins in the playoff each game too, let's not forget KD's current situation at 32, Harden at 31. Kyrie the youngest one is fragile. 

Not saying Nets are a bust but pointing out all the negatives.
Well, outside of my belief that a foundation of three ISO scorers won't work (noted after following OKC with PG and Melo), Kyrie got exposed here. He's a negative on defense and he's not going to carry with his scoring. Harden took a super backseat to let Kyrie work and it wasn't enough. They don't seem to have chemistry and Harden probably thinks he's better.
Says someone who would never trade his core for ours. We need one more lottery pick bad.
Notice the keyword there in lebron.
"...and LeBron"

Then Kyrie asked for a trade because he didn't want to play under someone like LeBron. He's going to take whatever shots he feels he should without regard for the rest of his team.It's what he did for us. Just go watch the Bucks playoff series with him on the Celtics.
We saw this for 3 years before LeBron returned. It's the same story with him.
He's defitnely a factor. But defense and depth are their biggest issues, I agree.
Was there any doubt that the best shooter of all time and a centerpiece for the best team-franchise of all time is better than Kyrie?
Harden was playing passive

That’s not on kyrie, even with the second unit James didn’t take his opportunities to score.
Dude, this is fucking James Harden you're talking about.

If Harden wants to score, he. will. score. 

Everyone with half a brain knew Harden would play facilitator in that big 3 lineup because he is significantly the better playmaker than KD and Kyrie. 

Harden will be acting as the PG going forward so he is trying to figure it out. Instead of blaming the loss on Kyrie, how about we just shut up and give them the time they need to figure out how they'll play? 

The greatest yet most ball dominant players in this generation and y'all acting like shit is supposed to click from the get go.
Especially given that harden was 6-14 tonight.
Lol but Bosh was merely a top 20 player with two top 3 to 5 players. Harden is way better than Kyrie.
Harden is 10000% asking for a trade and causing drama like he did in Houston if they expect him to play 3rd fiddle 🤣🤣
Bone head turn overs is the norm for harden
[deleted]
This comment reads exactly like someone who didn’t watch the game considering harden had 11 assists compared to kyries 5 and only had 1 extra turnover
Scheduling is so complicated that it just happens sometimes.
I'm total casual too, but I guess it was a home-and-home thing. Maybe something to do with covid? I honestly can't say, sorry.
Exactly. I can't think of any scenario or offense in which Kyrie and Harden can work together. Both excel in the same type of offense and both have similar skillset. Harden may shoot a 1000 more threes than Kyrie, but both need the ball in their hands to be successful.
Kyrie/Harden is not a good pairing.

They gotta stagger the minutes so it's always one with KD and the other can switch at times with the bench.
lol
With Kyrie going MIA like he did no team would have taken him
Good point. Don't recall them losing back to backs against the cavs either 🤣
People keep saying this without the context that for multiple games we had zero point guards. I think we had 8 or 9 players injured.
You're really gonna focus on the one line after a whole paragraph of gassing them up? Lol, idk how sensitive you are but thats far from "talking down". Its just realistic analysis of the big picture.

By serious threat I mean to go deep in the playoffs. I know we just lost to them twice in a row and they are can really expose our weaknesses, but at the end of the day, no one is really expecting them to make a serious run in the playoffs, and thats okay. They're a young inexperienced team learning how to win and just making it to the playoffs and playing a couple tough games against a top team in the playoffs is a huge step forward for them. They could make any series tough on anyone but which of these teams fully healthy are you taking this Cavs team to beat in a 7-game series in the playoffs: Bucks/Nets/Celtics/Sixers (Heat are off to a slow start but I expect them to get back into that mix by playoff time)? Because they're gonna have to beat one of them just to make it to the 2nd round. I know they're a good story now but lets not overreact to 2 games, especially with KD out one of them.
Fr hahaahaaa
[deleted]
Damn, playing Heat tomorrow. Kind of a fucked up schedule.
Haha.

Was it scheduled rest or something?
On the second night of a back to back for Philly, without Embiid playing. 

But yes.
I care.
Lmaooo
Makes sense. I thought I was going crazy for a second, I was like "I swear I just saw these 'Sexland / East runs through Cleveland' comments a couple nights ago." Then I checked the schedule and sure enough it happened twice in a row.
Word, thanks.
Dude it’s a couple of regular season games, it’s pretty irrelevant. Vegas has them as second most likely to win the championship right now. Everyone likes to criticize Vegas odds, but if they were easy to beat, anyone could be a millionaire from betting sports. 

Betting markets tend to be a decent reflection of reality, Vegas lines are tough to beat. They are certainly more accurate than some random people on reddit.

Unless you have made millions betting sports, don’t tell me you are smarter than Vegas.
RemindMe! 5 months
You think they could make playoffs now?
He gave yall a ring lol
My bad, yes all three were playing first game
Thanks, I know. They’ve had a different lineup for the last 3 games. Give them some time to figure out how to work together. If we hit March and still look like this, we may be in trouble.
The super nets giving up all their picks for a first round exit to Cleveland without Bron would be anarchy
Do you really think the nets could end up as the 8th seed for that to happen though?
At this point if you guys don’t do whatever it takes to matchup with the nets I’ll be disappointed
really hope you guys get to the playoffs, that'd be sweet to do it without Lebron
I played 2K with this Nets team after they got Harden. I sim the regular season and play the playoffs. 3 years in a row, conference finals, playing the Cavs to 7.
They had to use the Nets to destroy the Nets
Omg please
RemindMe! 3 months
I’m not sure if we’ll get to the playoffs but I’d love it too
Need for this to happen!
Agreed
The Nets would have to work hard for that 8th seed to get a chance to meet the Cavs in the first round
Bring the lube for playoff KD. It will be a beatdown.
Except the Cavs aren't making the playoffs this year. With all due respect to the excellent job Bickerstaff has done so far, two of either the Heat, Raptors, Magic or Bulls are knocking the Knicks and Cavs out of their respective playoff pictures once the season's over. The Cavs aren't beating Boston or LAL these next two games and those last two Nets games were the "peak," if you can even call bringing it to a team that would rather rest and lacks any semblance of depth or chemistry yet impressive. Doubt they'll even be *close* to splitting the b2b home games vs an actually-established juggernaut at home vs Milwaukee next month.
Y’all ain’t making it, but hey Sexton is really good.
yall would get swept lol
He dropped 40 two days ago and they lost
Their defense is literally Swiss cheese. It makes opposing teams hungry and it’s full of holes.
That's unfair.

I don't think these Nets would be able to get to a 3-1 series lead in the playoffs.
Jesus, I never thought about the fact that their thoughest rotation player might be Jeff Green.
one thing that really pissed me off

so i got off work in the 3rd got home with like 1:12 left in the 4th. it was 110 to 122. harden and kyrie were both sitting and it looked like everyone had accepted it was a cavs victory. 

yeah it was probably done at that point but like damn, yall apparently put together the strongest offensive unit in the NBAs history, and 2/3 of it is active. And yall don't think you could make 4 3s in a minute. probably more unsure if they could get any stops in that minute
BUT KYRIES HANDLES lmao
I can’t believe you’ve done this
They’re a House of Cards
Oof. Idk about this take. The might not win it but I don’t see them folding like the Clippers did.
Those Nets unprotected picks are looking pretty good for the Rockets right now ngl
It's the regular season, the Clippers issue was their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th best players underperforming hard
It doesn't help that our coach is brain dead either. If you've seen our games, you'd know
I respect the bold prediction, partner. And while i do hope they implode, i cant not see them going the distance with them superstars.
I love how quickly the consensus can change on this sub. Not even a week ago most people were saying the Nets would just wreck shit, and those saying that they'd be exploited pretty easily were in the minority. Now they're getting clowned HARD and I love it. They're a massively flawed team trying to make up for it by just throwing superstars together and hoping for the best. It seems there was no consideration for how they might go together

This will be the KG/Pierce trade all over again I swear
this all prisoner-of-the-moment bs analysis. The Nets are absolute beasts. Zero of these regular season games matter. Zero. What you guys don't realize is the Nets will have a full roster after the vet buyout market. By that time they'll have their rotations, sets, chemistry, and other issues down and they'll be ready to roll. This team is legit scary, the closest thing to the heydey warriors. If they played the Cavs in a playoff series right now it would be a massive beatdown. KD is better than all the cavs players combined.
This hurts me because I was such a huge Steve Nash fan growing up and now my all time favorite player is coaching a joke of a super team
Especially with Harden on the team.
Of course it is, but leave us be, let us savor this
Lets agree to disagree.

Tell you what, if this Nets team makes it to the final I’ll eat my shirt.
Yeah and Nets with KD would win against the Cavs.... right? If they're struggling against the Cavs imagine how they'd fare in the playoffs with their nonexistent paint defense.
Yeah, people are either forgetting or not watching but the Cavs system is built on playoff-level defense and extreme hustle 100% of the time. It's not just "a little hustle", they're one of the youngest teams in the league and they play like it. I'm just hoping it's sustainable.

But yeah this Nets team is about to seriously score on teams, like drown them..
Harden alone should be able to beat these Cavs, let alone Harden & Kyrie

Nets so far are such a disappointment damn
I think dinwiddie being hurt and not leading their 2nd unit is a really big loss I haven’t seen mentioned much.
https://statsdmz.nba.com/pdfs/20210122/20210122_BKNCLE.pdf


I included the team rebounds.  The box score only shows individual rebounds.
Hmm interesting...it does seem that those are counted separately which is kinda confusing. 

So team rebounds would be something like “offensive player misses a shot and the ball bounces out of bounds“?
Thanks James!
It’s for James harden. The issue isn’t talent, the issue is fit.
For a top 5 player ... Problem is Houston didn't even take these players which is the strange part.
During the off-season, everyone on this sub was saying that the Nets young core is mediocre and that the rockets would never do that deal. Lol. Just shows how many people actually watched nets games.
If they don't win a championship with this big three, I feel like the Nets will FOREVER be a joke franchise.

Go all in on KG and Paul Pierce and get nothing? Spend years in the lottery and finally get a young core, then give up everything for three giant pieces that have all shown they're more than willing to leave situations they don't like?

Championship or Bust has never been a more apt phrase
Giving LeVert and Allen was not surprising; the fact that *Houston* didn't wind up with either of them is what is mind-boggling.
Dinwiddie not being there to run their 2nd unit is a big loss
what’s mind boggling about trading two role players for a top 5 player ??
If you wouldn't trade those players for harden you're insane lol
Levert was redundant with Harden coming in but yeesh, losing Jarrett should’ve been avoided at all costs
Yes, it does make your mind blog, doesn’t it?
Who else you expect them to give up for Harden...
Could've just gave up 190 pounds of dead weight Kyrie
Is it really mind boggling? They got James Harden. You can think they gave up too much but it shouldn’t be too confusing why they did it.
terrible asset management
[deleted]
People are saying this but it’s really not true at all. Exum is a negative value contract and Allen is an expiring. Given that the rockets aren’t contending this year, that means that to them, the asset is just Allen’s restricted rights (ie the right to pay him in restricted free agency).


So they basically got a first in exchange for (1) taking on exum’s negative value contract and (2) giving up the right to pay Allen . That’s perfectly reasonable—in fact, I’d argue that it’s a net win for them. Allen is a good player, but he’s not winning them a ring this year, and after this year he’s by definition a neutral value contract.
Isn't Woods a 4 and Allen a 5?
Agreed. Shit house trade. Just hold onto him and look for a better deal. 

Cleveland committed robbery here.
The Rockets FO are not known for making great trades.
Mr. Steal Yo Jarret
What did they even give? Like nothing
Wet bandits
You can actually (kinda) connect this trade as being a continuation of the Kyrie trade. It's not a perfect match but...

Kyrie was traded for IT, Jae Crowder, BKN's pick, etc.

Crowder + Shumpert + D-Rose (free agent pickup) were traded for George Hill & Hood

George Hill was traded to Milwaukee for their first-round pick

Milwaukee's first-round pick was traded for Jarrett Allen & Taurean Prince.
This is all secretly a long several year 14d chess game so kyrie can return back to his true team, the Cleveland Cavaliers
I’m convinced the Cavs FO is the best management of any American sport in sports history and no one even knows it
Hey. I’m a new basketball fan and i lurk on this subreddit constantly n I’m always reading stuff about this trade. Somehow this most recent trade is somehow linked to the kyrie to Celtics trade in some way? If you could explain it to me I’d soooo appreciate it, I’m dying to know!
The only sad thing with trading Kyrie is it meant Lebron had enough and wanted out.
Dante Exum and the Bucks 2022 1st round pick
he's shooting 45% from 3 on 4 attempts per game this season. where the fuck did that come from?
Always has been
Shhh sweet prince. It's Brooklyn's problem now.
Forreal the dude is pretty charismatic, I get why the IG kids like him
His dad made me hate the whole family from the beginning and but lamelo made it impossible for me to keep hating
Ha Ha Ha
I was so prepared by media to hate the dude. Fuck the media, this kid is wonderful. This rookie class is way more fun than advertised.
K..KYRIE!!!
KY-KYRIE
That's the one comment i wanted to see 🤣
THANK YOU
>20 years ago, he'd averaging 8 PPG

2 years old and already averaging 8 PPG in the NBA, he's truly special.
DONT YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH ABOUT THE BEST. OR SEXTON GONNA SHUT IT FOR YOU REAL QUICK
The fuck is this small baller attitude?
Pj tucker incoming
yes man, it's so worth it. It's relatively easy to pick up a backcourt rotation that is good enough. I wouldn't be surprised if they get it done this season, but even if they don't, all of their guys are under contract for next season as well.
Them being too heavy was always going to be the major criticism of this team, and in the playoffs that bench is going to have to step up or this team isn’t going anywhere even with that big three. 

Honestly I don’t even think big threes are the way to go, because you’ll easily run into these situations. The Warriors just got stupid lucky that they drafted and kept their big three on small contracts before they expired when they exploded. 

And even then now, after they’ve paid each of them what they deserve, the team is flat out struggling. It’s just much better to invest in two superstars and surround them with quality role players and a strong bench of mid tier players instead of pooling that money into one extra guy surrounded by crap
I mean what team in the NBA wouldn't be screwed if they have a superstar and he goes down? Do you think the Lakers aren't screwed if Lebron can't play?
I like the sound of that
Somehow it’s actually okc
That will be the most hilarious implosion in sports history
Incoming: "The Nets will have a $94m luxury tax for the 2021-2022 season"
can they also get Gobert as their 5th starter?

i just want to see him explode when they dont pass him the ball
Joe Harris for Muscle Chestbrook. Deal?
I don't think many Thunder fans would object to that. 😎
Omg I will not be able to sleep tonight because I’ll be laughing until tomorrow
PLEASE I NEED TO SEE IT
I would pay money to see this. Please. I've never realized how much I've wanted something. You have the best comment of this thread. 

Ever seen those make-a-wish kids they let play basketball who heave the ball at the rim because they're strong enough to shoot properly? Those are WB's threes.
LOL now none of them can play together.
How have the Rockets been doing since the Harden trade? I’d imagine that would be pretty galvanizing for the locker room
Nnnnnnnnn
He said that to the Cs?
Maybe I missed something but I’ve never seen a comment saying KD could carry a team. KD hasn’t been on his own in like 7 years.
Were not talking bout you rn.
I hate KD but even I recognize he could carry a team. The guy just came back from an Achilles tear (which was partially your team's fault) so I would probably give him some time. And Harden can definitely carry a team, it's just obvious that fat suit Harden is having trouble figuring out where he fits.
He’d go invisible with the Rockets too, outside of this year. He just does it sometimes, usually when he’s letting someone else take it up the floor or getting his assists
I think yes.  I'm liking the new Rockets.  Aaaannnd... oh yeah the shit ton of draft picks are only going to make the Rockets better.
Please no
Pt II

"Okoronto"
pls no leave us alone
>We're coming for you LeBronto

FTFY
> We're coming for you ~~Toronto~~ Tampa.
lebron signing a 1 week contract just to do it one last time
Sexronto
His trade value is already negative. They would have to give up something for someone to take his contract.
No one wants him from what I heard last. Could be wrong.
I agree. Dude just is not good at all anymore. He’s completely washed
But love is the answer
Or they’re gonna be on SouljaDocs
Man, he played 37 minutes on the game he actually played, he just got injured in the game right after and that's it. People seem to be conflating salary's expectations too much with production too, he of course can still be a positive for us when playing. 

Feel like he should definitely come off the bench though, and thinking about fit, I feel like Love/Allen would be the best fit right now with him back. And before anyone asks, he played 56 out of 65 games last season while averaging 30+ minutes, which looks alright.
Yeah I kind of think he might not be a value add game wise. Maybe just veteran leadership wise.
='( He's a beast. Gonna miss him a lot
Maybe I’m being reactionary, but this team already seems dangerous. One of my favorites to watch right now.
Okoro Garland Sexton Allen is probably the best young core in the league can't even think of any group close to that
how did i not even notice that the cavs built a solid starting lineup when tf did that happen
Phelps on 92.3 was saying Allen was going to be a piece to another trade in the future. I really hope not.
I personally liked the Chris Gatling Tractor Traylor years.
Fat Shawn Kemp.....lol
Yea lol u had LeBron 2 years ago and were whooping the east 1 seed every year. It's like if the raps start winning early next year and saying "I haven't been this excited for a team since Kawhi left"
It's because every non LeBron year between his first and second stints was awful. We always got hope at the start of season and end up finishing at 20 wins, this is the first year where it seems like we can sustain 0.500.
2020 felt like 10 years so
Dated reference, but it checks out.
Ngl I thought with our shitty FO we would be doomed for the foreseeable future so it's more than that we're actually good, you know? It's that we're *unexpectedly* good. I keep expecting something bad to happen and for us to return to the bottom of the league
I was responding to the “IRVING OUTDATED”
Reminds me of Landry Fields
Aahhh the old Michael Carter-Williams except he peaked in his first game
One wash and he is done.
Tyreke until he turned it around
His later teams don't use him like that.
He was pretty good on the Clippers his first year there too
I only tuned in for a bit but he obliterated TT in the post. Got a solid seal on him and just feasted.
Blabla, Shamet is getting wide open shots, he is just bad
I remember being pissed bc of how Fultz bombed and we had no young guard depth; little did we know we'd be drafting good combo guard/wings for days the next few years.
I will not tolerate any Rodney McGruder erasure, he was at least two of those 2nds
I think that credit goes to reddick if anyone.
i think it was more being jj's teammate
To be fair, shamet looked way better the years prior. I think the thought process was, “at least we can add some dope shooters around Kyrie and KD”. But unfortunately he’s regressed an astronomical amount.
Shamet looked decent on D for the 5 months he was on the Sixers.
Not like Nash played D. Not like D'Antoni coached a defensive team.
Yes!
Chrome.
Plus all three of the Heat's big 3 were good to great defenders, especially for those first two years

Edit: phrasing
Hey man don't bring up relevant information, you might make a Nets fan nervous
He's never beaten the Cavs in Cleveland I don't think. Pretty sure he's beaten them a few times in Boston however.
That game was wild
Man nets made people so rich. Boston got brown/Tatum and y’all got sexton.

Hope the Rockets get a guy like that from the nets picks
His bad defense and selfish attitude caused the Cavs multiple games when he was with them... pretty sure it was obvious what I was talking about, at least to other Cavs fans.
Yeah Sexton going off Wednesday didn’t help. They were keying on him in the 2nd game and he made some good finds leading to FTs and easy paint points
Cavs fan PTSD
If you count the legal points, I win easily. If you count the Cleveland points, they have a chance at stealing this game.
That was calculated. He knew mail-in ballots were counted last, so it would help his conspiracy theory to claim victory when only in-person voting was counted and he would be winning. He knew he was going to lose.
politics isn't like, a tv show.
Then he got banned and can't say shit looool
He dropped the hereby though. Usually works.
Kind of like the time he “hereby ordered” American companies to stop doing business with Chi-na 🤡
I can believe a bunch of people getting scammed. I still can’t believe Trump conned an entire country enough to get 270 votes. And they’re still fighting for him 🤣
You know whats nuts? On this last one, he received the second most amount of votes ever in U.S. history
Pls stop. I still get nightmares 🤦
The Harden-est road
Man I was eating dinner, now I got Vietnam flashbacks.
I really wonder what could have happened if Jim Buss swallowed his ego and hired Phil Jackson instead of Dantoni and Nash never got injured by dame on like the first game of the season.

Funnily enough both these teams have Nash and Dantoni on the on the sideline all season LOL
Well those guys made it to the finals.
Yeah it's an even bigger disappointment
In no universe is Kyrie a top 10 player
[deleted]
We're trying not to overreact here, you need to calm down.
Man before the season, people were freaking out saying it was pretty much a guaranteed ring. We got Steve nash, covering up our biggest weakness on offense, and we swapped from the second best centre to the best centre. And kobe got his knees fixed that off-season. On top of that we got antawn Jamison.

It may not be exactly the same, but I'd take kobe and dwight from the year before over anyone on the nets. 

And then it all fell apart and we fired the head coach to get interim GOAT bickerstaff
I disagree with your rational and logical analysis. Nets worst team of all time, full stop.
Yes
Bro, those Warriors were 4 points away from winning the finals. How is that disappointing?
Porque no los dos 🤷🏼‍♂️
So who is Kobe, Shamet?
Just comes down to luxury tax at that point though, right? And we know Dan will spend
Bigger difference is him as an expiring deal vs 1.5 seasons left. It’s drummonds contract that is now somewhat interesting
Way worse

2011 heat was 5th in def rating. 2nd best of the heatles era.
There are parallels but the 2011 Heat had even worse depth than this. The 4th and 5th starters were Carlos Arroyo and Joel Anthony for much of the season

With that said, they had a defense
2011 heat were great on both ends though.
They were 3rd on offense and 5th on defense.
This nets team will be 2011 heat without the defense but better offense
Worse is an understatement. Wade was one of the best shotblocking guard only behind jordan. Lebron was a dpoy candidate in his heatle days and chris Bosh was an amazing pnr defender. That heatles team blows the current nets team by a mile defensively
And no Lebron James.
Lebron, Wade, and Bosh are all good to great defenders depending on the night. They had no depth but come on man
Way worse. The heat had almost DPOTY Lebron. Nets best defender (considering who’s on the floor in the clutch) might be Harden or Jeff green.
Damn
Uhh.. the Big 3 Heat never had a flaw remotely like what this Nets team seems to have.
It's not just that. Almost every champion at least in the last decade or so had great role players. Currently, DeAndre Jordan or Jeff Green (or maybe TLC) is their 5th most important player. I'm not sure if any of them would get major minutes on the last 4-5 championship teams.
That's interesting but the Heatles and the 2016 Cavs didn't have a DPOY.
Kyrie isn't going to take a step back.
I mean we'll see what they can get. I'm not confident they're going to be able to solve all their problems. And 15-20 games is not going to change the fact that you can't play Jordan 25+ minutes with good production, and yet he's literally the only big guy they have.
Do they have anything to trade? I mean that literally. What do they have of any value that can be traded for someone that's going to help?
The issue with that idea is that 2 of their 3 stars are atrocious defenders and the other is only average.

No team that puts James Harden out there is going to be good defensively. It isn’t a possibility. And things will only get worse each year as they get older with no picks coming in to add young, high energy players.
Kyrie needed to be the centerpiece in the Harden trade so they didn’t need to give up so much depth
Drummond is available.
Yeah, that’s the real question that I’ve been posing since the trade. Say the Bucks. Jrue/Donte/Khris on Harden/Kyrie/KD is, while not great, a much better matchup than Giannis on DJ. Yeah I know the Bucks just lost but they also are coasting to some degree.
Shit, they could potentially get bounced in the first round against the Cavs if the stars align. They match up horrendously with CLE.
They aren’t stopping the heat either... that shooting with bam and jimmy attacking the rim is nightmare fuel for a team who’s defence has to be pack the paint
They can't guard the perimeter players either.
I assume that they'll be better than they are today regardless of where they end up. They need time to gel.

I also just know that Lebron's only weakness on the team is KD. Lebron has Kyrie & Harden figured out more than probably anyone in the NBA so if they get to the finals it's over before it even started.
And 01 lakers didnt even have bad defense imo. They just didnt give a shit(except maybe kobe) in the regular season after winning a title a season prior
Top 11 I believe because of the 2018 Warriors.
THANK YOU. Literally what I’ve been saying. It seems Cavs aren’t playing McGee (unless he’s injured). Assuming he isn’t injured, I hope we can pick him up seeing as how it doesn’t seem like Cavs are using him that much
Atleast Clippers looked decent in the reg season. This is just wow.
They shot like 55/50/90 against the Bucks and BARELY won. That should be indication enough.
I understand how Vegas odds work. You clearly didn’t read what I wrote. If Vegas odds weren’t a reflection of reality, and you know better, then why aren’t you a millionaire from betting sports? Why aren’t hundreds of thousands of other people millionaires from betting sports if Vegas lines so clearly deviate from reality? 

You say Vegas odds are wrong, put your money where your mouth is. Go get rich betting sports. Until then it’s just unwarranted confidence by the people downvoting me. It’s the same reason I’m able to make good money playing poker. Everyone thinks they are some sharp who knows better than everyone else.
Oooh I agree.  Might've still missed out but could you imagine if Sexton and Garland got to finish out the second half, especially with how good Sexton was looking at that point?
Sexton thrives under pressure though so I'd love to see him in an elimination game of any kind
Well LeBron wasnt in that draft class
Cheers Geoff.
Uhhh... he can't. [Drake senpai is busy rn](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsRhUHGXAAEaWhW?format=jpg&name=large)

Honestly I feel like we need to pare down on some pastas. Hard to keep track of them all.
We might not get many pastas this season simply because the reporters aren't at the arenas.
https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3rijs7/carmelo_on_shumpert_and_jr_not_playing_tonight_i/cwof953/
Don't take this from us, it's one of the few contributions r/nba has ever made
Ahh. The Nets' ceiling is the roof.
East does run through them
They really gave LeBron prime SexLand smh
lowkey kinda an underreaction tbh
Exactly, people don’t like Kyrie so they’re blaming him for our struggles. We simply don’t have the defensive personnel/scheme to keep us in these past two games. If not for him we lose by 25.
The old grizzlies coach JB bickerstaff
Damn, thanks for the breakdown, really informative!
True, true, but didn't Kyrie only request a trade since the it got leaked from the Cavs front office that they were tryna trade him for Bledsoe and PG? He also probably already had 1 foot out the door since he wasn't talking to teammates at all during that playoffs at times.

Also Altman called LeBron and asked if he should trade Kyrie, and LeBron adamantly said no, especially considering he was gonna trade Kyrie to the Celtics. Then Dan gilbert pushed Altman to go through with the trade anyway just cuz of the 1st round pick which they thought would be top 3 but wasn't.

Also when IT failed his physical, they coulda pulled the trade too which Bron was pushing for, but they gave in when Boston included and additional 2nd rounder. Just straight up FO incompetence.
JJ Hickson was sofa king good I wouldn't even have traded him for prime Amar'e...
Just to here that name brings a smile to my face. I haven't got to watch him.  Dose he have a Lazer for a 3? Like no arch at all, like his dad?  His dad would of been one of the best big men's ever if he came over in his prime.
Turner too. Who’s stopping them, jeff green?
Where have I heard that before
Huh, feel like I’ve heard this before...
Agree. They can fairly easily cover Kyrie's offence and without him they don't have such a big hole on defence. 

If you had to cut one, he's it.
Kyrie just takes away so many possessions and potential buckets from Harden it's insane. It's not a coincidence they lost both games in which he took the most shots
Harden isn’t “being fat”. He played insanely well against the Magic and Bucks. He hasn’t driven the lane since Kyrie’s been back. He’s trying to gel/ find his place which I respect. But taking the backseat is not gonna be it if we want to win.
Well they've been playing Harden enough minutes that he'll be in shape soon, if he's not already. He has to be averaging close to 40min/game with the Nets.
Jarrett Allen would be nice
Jordan was so fun to watch man, I feel so bad that age is getting to him.
hes talking about brooklyn, they play the heat not us
I’ve never felt old before until now. I’m 29.
Too young? Lebron was just there in 2003–2010.

...fuck I'm turning 40 this year
Yea but as a cavs fan they were frustrating to watch. Point guard who was a non scoring threat and the offense was legit give the ball to bron.
How did you miss all of the mike brown teams lol

Or the Cavs in 2015 and 16
Doesn’t sound like it
Sorry I don't have the Cavs flair, but I refuse to even entertain the idea of bringing Kyrie back to the Cavs.  Drummond to the Nets, Kyrie to the Bulls, Cavs get Lauri + cap fillers.  Cavs have their young core for the future in Garland/Sexton/Okoro/Lauri/Allen
Drummond doesn’t even solve their problems. As a wise man once said he can’t even guard a parked car
This might be the year they bottom out.  The twins and white sox are going to be good
Hasn’t that sentence been true for at least 5 years now?
Does that mean we will get Playoff Harden?
Goddamnit don’t send me down that rabbit hole
He's Melo with better handles. Scoring while neglecting the rest of the game != winning.
Interesting enough basketball is a game where there are two sides to the floor.
Yeah well just wait till he comes back from taking two months off after his fifth cousin's thrice-removed's quinceanera and see how dominant he is then
It literally is an efficient play style if he’s shooting 55% FG
It's pretty incredible that Kyrie can score 38 on 58/44/100 shooting with 2 TOs and people still criticise him for being inefficient.
Imagine watching these games where the Nets get roasted by what was the worst offense in the league, cough the ball up repeatedly, and getting bullied by bigs and your takeaway is that Kyrie spends too much time in the midrange
Good points, but I'd like to add that both Durant and Kyrie are proven playoff winners, whereas Harden hasn't achieved that status yet, so if you trade Kyrie you're giving up a proven quantity to rely on a question mark (and whatever you're getting back in the kyrie trade also factors in of course). And while it's true that Kyrie got exposed on defense, Harden is little better in that regard on the perimeter.
I'd be lethal with LeBron
Sure. But the Cavs went from legitimate title contenders to not even an actual shot once Kyrie left.
But he got hot for 4 games against the Warriors!
Anyone who is saying that Kyrie isn’t part of the problem doesn’t understand basketball. He’s put up numbers and has done so efficiently, but he’s not looking to get anyone else involved. He’s only trying to create for himself, and as you said, then let’s anyone walk right past him on defense.
He doesn’t play winning basketball unfortunately. The casual fan will look at the box score and consider this a great performance by him, but he/she couldn’t be more wrong.
Facts. Thats the deal when you have these kind of players. Some nights it'll be Kyrie's turn to feast. Some nights it'll be Harden or KD. Realistically not all 3 can feast equally. So fucking tiring reading these asinine opinions. People treat it like its 2K.
Harden wants to win. I don’t think he cares for points as much as Kyrie
I think lowry would be perfect for that team. But I love him
Yas sure, stats show that i didn't watch the game..
What I am saying is that Harden killed a sorta half fastbreak a few times.
He grabs the ball and stops, dribles and starts looking around. 
Instead he could continue the fast break, draw the foul, kick it out, do anything but just stop and start dribbling and contemplating life.
You saw it in the forth, when Kyrie came in everything became faster and they started attacking the point difference, but it was too late.
Did you watch the game? Be honest. Today I saw Kyrie hitting tough shots and attacking the rim and I saw Harden being very passive, iso-ing at the three point line a bit then passing to his teammates on the perimeter with the shot clock going down. Very disinterested, he doesn’t look like his normal self.
Yeah, I think 6-2 with Sexton or Garland available is pretty telling.

I wouldn't be surprised if the Cavs' offense moves up to middle of the pack by the end of the season.
I believe one of the games we had more players out than actually got on the floor lol
I'm simply commenting on your unspoken assumption that the Nets as the roster is now constitute a serious threat. Just because you were able to throw a bunch of stars together doesn't mean much until you prove it later. Figured Nets fans of all people would've learned that lesson, but look no further than the Clips last season too.
No no, that's ya'lls.
Yeah it was a scheduled loss. They got a back-to-back, so prolly saving him for the Heat.
still, we were up by 30.  Simmons did not play well
Cavs fans care lol.
I hope they bring the bubble back for the playoffs. This method really doesn't work that great, there are too many postponements.
Ooof this stretch has been bad.  Drummond started being even more selfish half, plenty of injuries, and just dysfunction.
He was a part, of course, hit a great shot. Since then, what? You didn’t respond to that part
You don't have a bench, you are already in trouble
Flashbacks to the Nets giving up their future for PP and KG, only to get swept by the LeBron Heat. Of course, now instead of LeBron on the Heat it's a someone amazing like Sexton on the Cavaliers!
Especially if (when) they get dominated by a player they sent to the Cavs in the Harden trade lmfao
It’s not anarchy. It’s fate
hold up butterly... is this porn?
Kyrie losing to Nets Pick wearing his number. Saddest timeline for flat earthers
Subscribe
This is what I am here for.
Oh shit. If this happen, Holy fuck!
Then Cleveland goes on to beat the Lakers in a seven game series finals...
The Nets will be our new Raptors once we get back to the playoffs
I think we can actually do it this year too! I have literally never seen the Cavs play remotely competent basketball without LeBron on the roster so this is pretty exciting for me!
The only team that could fuck us out of the playoffs would be the Heat imo. I don't think the Hawks and Knicks will keep their spots in the playoffs and once we elevate JA to the starting 5 after we trade Drummond at the deadline, we'll be even better. I think the Cavs are a playoff team. No bias of course...
I think they definitely make it. They have a great record when Sexton and Garland play and got even better with the Nets trade
Lol you got downvoted for speaking facts
Great. Nets are better and its not even close. Young players with zero playoff experience are gonna beat KD now? You high?
Vet buyout market will help. Regular season doesn't matter. All these games are meaningless. Think of these games as nfl preseason games.
That would just be folding the same. Gonna need a 3-0 lead for the harder or some real implosion material. 

Like Kyrie trying to burn Harden's beard off on halftime of game 7, because the saging can't cure it's bad strip club juju.
Thats unfair.

They havent even played 3 games together and folks already making these statements. Crazy lol.
2 games in and here comes the hot takes lol
So people are ALREADY giving up on this Nets team? After 2 losses?
2 Robins in their championship teams and a guy who was in a team that bricked 27 threes. This team needs a lot of work
Durant and Westbrook were up 3-1 until GS came back. Durant left for that same team that beat him. Unbelievable.

Harden couldn’t win when GS lost Durant in the 2019 playoffs. 

Irving is in a weird situation. Bipolar? Not sure.
LOOOL damn you had me
Damn the takes in r/nba really are the hottest.
I'm definitely saving all these takes to revisit for laughs come playoff time.
I think there's gonna be a lot of crow being eaten come playoff time.
Would the even make the playoffs in the west?
Takes like these are going to be hilarious one day
Yeah I don’t know how well they’re built with the lack of depth and lackluster defense but can we give them more than 1 game together before making predictions
Most people weren’t saying that? Everyone was meming the fact that they have all the offense without the defense.
Jesus Christ. They've played one game together.
\+ that last game with KD should have ended in regulation anyway, not complaining (that much) about it though, it gave us all a cool 2nd part for the game. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

^(But that game definitely should have ended in regulation.)
KD’s a good defender though. He’s also seven feet tall with a seven foot five wingspan who got votes for DPOY a couple years ago. He would definitely improve their defense in all aspects.
Bro the Cavs are 8-7... they aren't bad.
yeah, that is one instance where it would be a team rebound.  From the rulebook:

>An individual rebound is credited each time a player retrieves a live ball or purposely taps a live ball to a teammate immediately following a missed field goal attempt or a missed free throw attempt. No individual rebound is credited in situations where the whistle stops play before there is player possession following a shot attempt. Instead only a team rebound is credited to the team that gains possession following a stop in play.

If a lose ball foul is called while battling for the rebound, that would also be a team rebound.


There are [examples in here](https://videorulebook.nba.com/rule/rebound/)
Thanks James!
And they have no bench. Joe Harris is the only guy they have that even belongs on an NBA roster. Next season will be better when Dinwiddie comes back because he's like a 6MotY if he's healthy. As it stands their big 3 are all gonna have to play 35+ minutes a night to stay in games unless all 3 just happen to pop off for 30 at the same time. And they really have nothing left asset wise to improve the roster.
I wouldn't say fit as much as depth
The issue they should have shipped kyrie's ass instead of their depth but who knows if the rockets wanted him anyway
also, it's about intangibles and how you send the message to your teammates and whatever future rookies on the Nets.  

ie. Harden not hustling or even trying to help his team by fouling a ball handler to stop an alley-oop form happening and making sure the play is on the floor
If I was a Nets fan I’d be furious about giving those two up (and more) for that bearded slob. Levert and Allen were part of the soul of that team. 

I’m lowkey real happy that the Cavs are 2-0 on them.
On this sub people insist that fit doesn't matter, only talent does.
Yeah talent wise it was fair the issue is they need a center to replace Allen bad. Losing LeVert was whatever, losing Allen is hurting them a lot
But we need jarret Allen off the bench right now to play defence on jarret Allen.
In retrospect they probably prefer: Levert, Allen, Durant, and Harden. But Kyrie was already there, and thus their conundrum.
And talent.  Harden only plays one half of the game of basketball.  Less than that actually since he doesnt cut, set screens, or even move when he doesnt have the ball.  There is so much more to basketball than inefficiently scoring 35 on mediocre splits.
lmao the fit isn't an issue either, this is a regular season game against the bum cavs

the Nets will be fine in the playoffs
We did get Oladipo. Would have loved to have Allen and half the picks as well but yea I’m not sure why we didn’t get more talent back. Our GM thinks picks will lead to more of a long term haul.
No way people said that. That core was gold
I hardly watch Nets games and even I knew trading these guys was a bad idea
I remember a redditor saying "Why did Kawhi request PG, that team made the playoffs, with Kawhi they were good enough to win a ring!" Oh boy.
I guess I’m insane, because I *never* would’ve made this trade. Jim Harden was not even worth *half* of what they gave up for him.
Eh not really. They got a first rounder basically in exchange for Allen’s restricted rights.


Allen wasn’t winning anything for them this year, and after this year, all they have is the right to pay him market value. If I’m the rockets I’d much rather have a chance in the draft than the ability to keep Allen on what will likely be a neutral value contract
Every move for Houston going forward is about spending as little money as possible. Allen is going to get expensive soon
HOU is going to move forward w/ Wood as a C to better use his offensive versatility not a 4. 

They will still use double big lineups for flexibility, but they probably would rather go find a spacing wing for the 4 than pay Allen market value to fill the 5. 

The franchise really liked the 5 out playstyle that small ball gave to HOU, they just want to get more versatility on the team while maintaining that offensive identity.
I don’t want to pay Allen $100M+ next contract if I’m the rockets
Your take is well thought out, dispassionate and logical, but alas, not nearly hot enough!
Wood and Allen are both 5s.
Calm down trey songz
Dante Exum and a late first
Nah
I don’t want him. He’s a downgrade from sexton
No thanks. And kyrie was my favorite player in the nba from his rookie year until he left
https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20421382/cleveland-cavaliers-send-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-deal-including-isaiah-thomas

The Nets pick turned into Sexton who is developing great and having a hot year.

Isaiah Thomas(all-star 2016-17) played hurt for Boston in the previous year's playoffs, hurt himself more and never returned to greatness.

Lebron James would leave Cleveland for LA at the end of that season.
God damn what a steal
Always has been
Nani?
Zo is also extremely chill and nothing like his dad. Gelo on the other hand....
None of the kids are like their dad, and we dont really know how Lavar is as a parent. His kids love him.

TBH I am just glad they are doing well. both brothers look like they are here to stay in the league. hope liangelo gets in the league too.
How did the media advocate for you to hate them ? Because they gave their dad with a wrestling persona a platform?
lmaooo
Lmao nice
WHY ARE WE SCREAMING??
A big 3 that is also solid defensively is pretty damn dominant, look at what the Heat did. Granted, they had a pretty solid bench as well, but if any of the Nets big 3 were All NBA level defense this would be a different story. This particular superstar combination probably won’t win a championship, but that doesn’t mean a lineup that focuses on three stars is bad, either. Warriors had 2 damn good defenders in Klay and Draymond, and Steph wasn’t a slouch either.
I mean, they’re only struggling cause Klay is out. Put him back in and the warriors are pretty damn good.
> And even then now, after they’ve paid each of them what they deserve, the team is flat out struggling.

Injuries might be having an effect there.
I think one of the biggest arguments for a big three is that you can fill out the rest of your roster with veterans willing to take less for shot at a title (gasol this year). But since the Nets can’t do that mid season, they’re SOL
It depends, if Lebron goes down I expect AD to shoulder it. If KD goes down you expect Harden or Kyrie to hold it down. If Curry or Dame or Giannis goes down.....you’re fucked.
I’m still hoping you guys win the title this year just for that sweet sweet schadenfreude
Westbrook vs kyrie would be an amazing locker room battle, I feel like he's one of the few who would stand up to kyrie lol
He would actually be perfect for this team. Rim protector that takes the pressure off jordon and durant to guard bigs, rim runner who’s only shots come on alley oops and offensive boards? 

Exactly what this team needs in a dream world
I've been a Rockets fan since we were winning championships.
I've disliked Harden from day 1.  This year, the team was playing bad basketball with him on the floor.  They would just watch his fat ass dribble.
Now that he's gone you can see everybody hustling, passing, playing D... it's fun to watch again.  Also, we picked up some good players and a ton of picks.  I'm ecstatic.
Yep, the year after rookie Tatum and sophmore Brown took that team to the ECF despite both Kyrie and Hayward being injured.
YUP
I hate KD but is probably the best ceiling raiser in the NBA rn
Yeah KD going trough the hardest roads man... we know it!
BAH GAWD! That’s Lebron’s music!
SEXLONTO
Jokes on you we're not gonna be good enough to make the playoffs.

How the tables turn.
James Harden has requested a trade.
I also feel like he’s a great locker room guy. He’s the vet on the team and has that championship experience so I’m sure he’s the leader. Losing him could have a big impact on the young players’ development
Portland could use him but I’m not sure what they are willing to give up.
I bet the Nets would take him if they could lol
Sam Presti has entered the chat.
He can hit spot up threes and that's pretty much it
No defense and an inefficient offense. Even if he gets hot he’s gonna give it all back on defense and sulk.
When healthy Love is fine. I'm not saying he's a bad player. I'm just saying he's been injured a lot.
Udonis haslem style
We’ll take care of him. He’s already one of my favorite players and we’re lucky to have him. 

Take care of Kyrie for us, he’s a weird dude but I’ll always have a soft spot for him for what he meant to us for 6 years.
They are in that young, fun, and sneaky good period. Time will tell if they are future nuggets or future timberwolves.
I agree they’re fire but I think Trae-Collins-Hunter-Reddish-Okongwu has to be close (at least in terms of potential, plus Capela is still young)
I'd take Memphis (Ja, JJJ, Tillman, Bane, Clarke), but it's close
RIP Tractor
Tractor Traylor, damn, there's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
Wait. I thought "Fat Shawn Kemp" was a nickname for Tractor Traylor I'd never heard before.
Tbf the Cavs were basically unwatchable for the last two years
Lol I feel you. The roster was looking ROUGH right after lebron left. I remember peeking at the roster earlier this year though and thinking y'all have a sneaky good group. And that was before you added Allen!
How hype would it be to see Cavs vs Warriors finals 5.0: The Final Duel
His style of play is outdated though. Superstars do 90% of the work, but for teams to actually win in the NBA they need a strong bench. Irving is way too selfish to facilitate a strong enough bench.
atleast he had some nerve issue
Someone find Carl Landry’s stats
 In Landry Fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved, and were loved, and now we lie In Landry Fields.
So good he has a burger named after him in Australia.
I'll never forget when MCW got dealt by the Sixers and my very casual NBA fan friend was like "wasn't he the rookie of the year!?" And I was like yeah but he's trash man just listen to me on this one
Yeah was just about to say Shamet was JJ's guy.
I am not sure jj is taking his own advice rn 
with how he has started the season
Dantonis rockets with cp3 and harden were fantastic defensive teams
Yep, he did in Boston
Okay that was the statistic I heard on a TheRinger podcast. I misremembered it.
It might take time for the dark magic of the Nets pick to bear fruit, but it will be worth it. Nets pick always delivers star talent to other teams
Don't worry, you probably got him from us today. Take care of KPJ.
STOP THE STEAL!
It's crazy how Fox News's irresponsibly early Arizona call completely deflated any fraud claims he made. We could have easily gone into Wednesday with Trump heavily favored after getting FL and OH (by MSM. anyone actually looking at the numbers knew Biden had a comfortable edge in PA, NV, and a slight one in GA despite being behind in the vote count). His unfounded fraud claims might have had a much more receptive audience had that happened.
Not anymore, anyway. That shit wasn't a presidency, it was reality TV with real life consequences.
Women willing to get shot in the neck and die for him
He sure got lots of fans somehow 🤷‍♂️
~~nightmares~~ Dwightmares

Good thing he rehabbed his image with us and got a ring... to leave again
Don't forget the Ronnie Price, Nick Young, Robert Sacre, and Carlos Boozer days.
*🎶It's a Harden-knocks life🎶*
True. But as a kid, seeing that line up...I was expecting the chip. I was expecting to compete with Dwight.
Excuse me, but there are multiple universes which many Kyries dominate the sport known as basketball.

Kyrie is in tune with many dimensions and is able to transcend his greatness into each realm. By combining each Kyrie in each universe, his essence becomes the greatest of all time.

Just open your mind.
How did Luka not make this list?
Once you sage your home you'll become a believer.
Honestly if Nash doesn’t get injured, I think that team gets to the Conference Finals at the very least. They were really good in the limited time everybody played together at the same time (like 6-1 or something). But he got injured then the dominoes rolled from there.
The disappointment was them blowing 3 consecutive chances to do it
Curry bricked the game tying three
Joe Harris. The white chocolate mamba.
Will Dan spend without the assurance of LeBron taking them to the finals? That I'm not sure of. Regardless, Cavs fans have to be excited with how well they've been able to turn it around after LeBron/Kyrie left. Awesome job by their front office, honestly.
Yup
We’re they 5th in the first 20 or so games they had tho? Iirc that was the year they started around .500 right?
Udonis Haslem and Mike Miller were solid though . Just missed most of the season
Yeah, the Nets are better on paper but their defense would be the worst in 2 decades to win a title
Prime Wade and first-prime LeBron were excellent defenders. They had no rim protection but it didn’t matter when guys couldn’t get to the rim. 

Harden and Irving, however, are another story.
Fair enough
Geez! When your best defender might be Harden you are in trouble.
>	Nets best defender (considering who’s on the floor in the clutch) might be Harden or Jeff green.

No KD?
Yeah they had that LeBron guy instead.
Or just a DPOY candidate would suffice and qualify. Lebron was a runner up twice with the heat and with one third place as well in that 4 year run. 2016 Cavs played good TEAM defense with no actual standout defender.
Well I did qualify with "*pretty* much" ;).

I think LeBron kinda makes up for it though. He was *almost* a DPOY.
Lebron and wade werent shabby defenders themselves. Bosh improved on that end, too. 

While KD and Harden are okay defenders themselves now, they dont often exert enough effort on that end. Kyrie is kai so there’s that
A step back wouldn’t necessarily be a reduction in shots or role on the team.

I think that Kyrie should get subbed off early into the 1st and 3rd quarters at around the 6 minute mark and start the 2nd and 4th quarters with the bench unit where he can shoot freely against opposing benches.

KD and Harden should be able to make it work with surrounding pieces to finish the 1st and 3rd quarter strong (Small sample size of 2 games, but KD and Harden seem to fit together well).

In this role, Kyrie would still finish off games by taking a small rest from the 8-5 min mark.
Kyrie IMO (but who knows with this team).  And for the rest, replace 'trades' with 'ring-chasing vets signing for minimums'.
Not that I think Harden is an amazing defender, but Houston put out a top-10 defense in 2018, so defense with Harden is possible.  Old, low-energy Marc Gasol was a key mid-season addition for the Raptors in 2019.  And Kyrie is, frankly, tradable (although finding a team with defensive talent they're willing to give up for Kyrie and no picks is quite a headache).
the nets will also struggle mightly against  any sort of motion offense (the heat come to mind), their guys in isolation aren't terrible when locked in but they are just horrendous when it comes to offball action and screen awareness (especially Kyrie and Harden).
DJ on Giannis the other night was the one time this season DJ hasn't looked horrible.  Giannis isn't enough of an outside threat to pull DJ out of the paint nor was he strong enough to bully DJ.  If you're a Nets fan you can live with that matchup.  

Embiid will probably destroy DJ though because he can actually shoot.  Either DJ gives him wide open shots or contests and gets cooked.
Turner/Sabonis, Giannis, Embiid. The nets will get 40 dumbed on them every night by those guys.
Yup
You're right.
Him and Love are still injured afaik
We usually use him a lot, but he's injured atm.  After getting JA I'm betting we'd be more likely to get rid of Drummond before Javale.
Man our defense really needs to mesh, so many boneheaded mistakes when switching.  Hopefully it gets better and we aren't just screwed when switching more like we have this year.
You realize odds change based off reality right? That’s why you can’t be a millionaire that easy. Once it gets closer to the playoffs, the odds will drop when the Nets inevitably fall apart.
Yeah, I know the ref but very similar premise to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqXfjp4Yls8)
Who's the Man in SexLand?
To be fair, Harden can somehow replace Kyrie’s scoring. But yeah, eveyone’s at fault. No energy on defense
Grit 'n' Grind is real. One season from worst defense to top 3.
Ahhh. Now the paint points makes sense
pepelmao

idk why I'm getting downvoted unless everyone really hates that emote.
I feel like he’s aged 10 years since the Clippers
Congratulations. You have now been accepted to r/Uncles
Why you hatin on Eric Snow smdh
The disrespect to Damon Jones smh.
That Delly hustle
The OG Mike Brown Cavs were the kings of 87-83 games.
Haha yeah I can't ever hate Kyrie but he's obviously not someone we would want back. I haven't really watched any Bulls games this year; I was thinking of them as a possible third team but I don't know what they are looking for in the long term.
CLE would be directing Kyrie elsewhere.  No way in hell we'd want him.
Not even joking.  the kind of player they need is... jarrett allen
This might be a bridge type year, going to have to develop some position players, but their pitching is going to keep them around .500.
well they were one game away from winning a title 4 years ago, so no.  And, really?  No dude, they were legit title contenders in both subsequent seasons after.  Where you been?
[deleted]
Which kinda points to Harden even more when he's scoring less than 20 points on sub 40% shooting with his patented defense.
If your team needs the 6'1 PG to put up 38 points and play elite defense to win games, there are bigger problems than your PG "underperforming"
lol an offensive PG like Kyrie isnt out there to play defense just like Steph. Kyrie hasnt been the reason they've lost these last 2 games whatsoever, hes done his job and then some. Other players have to step up but the problem is that they dont have any other players outside of KD and Harden who can create or play elite defense
not exactly because hes only really creating shots for himself. it takes shooting an ungodly percentage from midrange to make up for the inherent difficiencies with that type of playstyle. kevin durant and the dubs had similar problems (tho not anywhere near to the same extent) in golden state, where kd would often get lost hunting his own shot on middys, and even when he was shooting well the offense could get real stagnant and struggle to score. instead, theyd look better with curry running things a lotta time

but anyways, thats not their biggest problem. their defense is garbage. they have 0 rim protection. deandre jordan fucking sucks
I know man. Its almost like he doesn't have to defend the opposing point guard l
im just pointing out one problem lmao.... obv yalls defense is by far and away the biggest problem and deandre jordan is one of the biggest defensive sieves in the league rn. and he fucking sucks on offense too. sets shitty ass screens and moves so slow on his rolls. imo id like to see yall giving green more mins as the center. youll get fucking creamed on the boards and at the rim, but thats happening anyways and at least green is a really good pnr partner for kyrie and harden
The Cavs went to the Finals in 2018 though?
are you trolling?
What? Kyrie is a great scorer. Also Steph Curry is a traffic cone on defense. Dude got dellavedova a contract
Anyone who blames this loss on kyrie doesn’t understand basketball either.
I reeeaaalllyy doubt Harden is OK with going from 25 fga/g and 35pts/g to 12 fga/g and 15pts/g

I just find that sooo hard to believe it wouldn't totally destroy his contract value and he would essentially be giving up millions on his next contract cause there no way he would get a max after that
I watched the whole game. He wasn’t looking for his shot but he was still getting guys involved and the nets role players bricked a ton of threes off his passes
So you really think the 2nd seed isn't a serious threat lmao? There is a reason we called it an upset when they lost.
lol. I see what you did there.
No shit, dumbass. Boston didn’t work and kd was injured.
Knee-jerk reaction. We did beat the bucks without kyrie, so we’ll see how it plays out.
LeBron about to leave AD for Sexton.

*I'm coming home*
Bruh this would be poetic irony at its finest
Don't forget Sexton was the Nets' pick. Oh dear lord this is funny to watch unfold.
it actually went 5 games, not 4.  I was at the game in brooklyn that the nets won lol
They lost handily to the underwhelming, Kyrie-led Cavs that first year w/KG and Pierce too, if memory serves me right...
Its crazy that they would risk their future again.
And the nets pick lmao
If you played the Nets in the playoffs right now you would lose the series quite easily. You have zero chance of beating them. Who guards KD? Nobody?  Then you lose. Next!
I’m biased but I’m not even slightly worried about the Heat missing the playoffs, they literally haven’t had half their roster for more than two games. Maybe the Cavs will make it, I like the way they play but I think the East is actually good for the first time in years so if I had to guess the Hawks and the Heat would make it over the Cavs, but we’ll see.
A 3-0 lead against the Suns in the finals would be the most hilarious collapse
Thanks for the mental image, I’m cracking up
I think it would be folding worse if they got swept by the cavs
I like how Kyrie puts up 38 points but he's still the butt of everyone's jokes. Kyrie needs to say fuck the NBA and go be rich somewhere and live life because y'all don't appreciate his greatness. On and off the court. It gets annoying to see honestly.
Someone save this thread please we’re gonna need it in 6 months
Let the nephews have their moment lol
Yeah, like what? Not saying they’ll be the team to beat, but damn. Let the 3 guys mesh and see what magic Nash can pull over the next 10 games.
You must be new here, welcome to r/nda
We all looked at the roster and concluded their defense would be horrible.  Until we see something to change our minds that's going to stay the narrative.
Yep some ridiculous takes. Let them gel, maybe some moves for some defence and size inside before trade deadline.
it's.. not exactly unfair, you're expecting 3 stars around 30 to suddenly play good defense, needing to play better than they have even if they try hard to make it up  


the holes this team has in defense and sheer like.. crazy fucking need in durant harden and kyrie to drop like 90 points a night (which they'll have to chuck  and play 35+ minutes especially in the playoffs)  


people keep saying they'll shore up problems in the buyout market, but i don't see enough depth or players that's going to be enough to fix terrible depth and defensive weaknesses, even if they got one really good dude as soon as he sat they'd get lit up anyway, he'd basically have to play 35+ too lmao  


i think the only real fix is trading kyrie for depth/defenders, you might get super lucky with ring chases but even then there's a thing called the cap so
RemindMe! 6 months
Have they actually all played together? Cuz I'm pretty sure Kyrie missed Harden's first game, and KD missed this one. They've played like one game and lost due to Colin Sexton having a career night lol
KD didn't even play in this game and people are acting like it actually means anything.
Yeah. I was joking.
Man it’s really annoying to be honest.
1.3k upvotes and counting...
It's not a hot take to think the 2020 Clippers are better than these Nets. Have you seen their respective benches?
If the Nets wasn't to be taken serious by anyone across the league they really need to step up and take care of business against teams like the Cavs

The cavs are hardly a playoff team, if the Nets are struggling with that caliber of team then they are even worse than I thought
If an offensive player shoots 2 free throws and misses the first one, does it count as a defensive rebound for an opposing team?
Thanks James!
They’re lucky Jeff Green is playing as well as he is. One injury and that roster gets dire.
Their big 3 on playoff mins are gonna be scary for anyone. Health is a concern.
Wow you're not kidding. I didn't even know Tyler Johnson was still in the league

I don't expect the Nets to have it all together this season, they're depleted and can't sign any good vets right now. Next year I think they'll destroy the league.
dinwiddie is a free agent...
Bruce Brown good
This isn't the final form for the Nets, as the should be a gravity well for free agents by next season.  Getting a guy as good as James Harden, who I think is the only guy to finish top 3 MVP voting the last three seasons is otherwise worth what they gave up.
They can play 50+ minutes each, pop off for 30, and still lose to an overachieving team.
they still have MLE and Dinwiddie's injury exception
I imagine they knew this going into it though and have plans on how to improve the supporting cast, it just may not be this year.
Landry Shamet is really good just young
They’re gonna be the prime buyout destination for guys who wanna go ring chasing, I feel like they’ll be able to shape it up to have something that resembles a bench by the playoffs
It's been two games and people said the same thing about Lebron and AD. Give the system some time improve before you say it's a failure. They have some decent players in the roster.
He was -18
I can’t imagine anyone really wanted Kyrie. He went awol for a team he *wanted* to be on. Cant imagine forcing him to a different team would make that front office feel comfortable
We’re you pissed last year?
I think this wholly depends on who they can get on the buyout market. If Norvelle pelle is their solution to their darth of interior defence, they’re screwed, but if somehow better options open up, they’re in a good position.
Thank you.

I got killed on the Nets subreddit when I said that Jim Harden is only a “generational talent” when the ball is in his hands, and that he gives you nothing otherwise. Scoring was not this team’s problem before he got there, and it’s only a problem now that he is because he doesn’t score enough to make up for their even worse defense.
It's *back to back* losses against the Cavs.
Y'all are crazy. It's been three games... They got James Harden. Chill for one second.
How is it a bad idea to move rotational prices for a top 5 player?
it's a bbucks 2022 pick, it's not a good pick.
Wood can be a PF rn with that slender frame.
still dont know how we pulled this off
A first we got for trading george hill lmao
Thats it? Why would the rockets sell so low on jarett? Or was it brooklyn’s decision?
I don't and wouldn't want him either lol
The fact that I even had to think about it is insane.

Sexton has been awesome and only getting better and it's a shame to say but Kyrie has probably already peaked.
Lmao. Nba Reddit is on drugs.
I think the problem was he started speaking his mind to the media around when he left. Heart in the right place, just dumb as a fucking rock but thinks he's the smartest person in the room. Turns out he's the Jaden Smith of the NBA.
Were you the kid who ran on the court and hugged Kyrie and asked him not to leave like Lebron?
damn bro espn got you, they made you dislike your favorite player.
Ahh okay appreciate it!
Always has been
He'll grow out of it, they all did.
Thats what im saying is Lavar kinda tainted my view of the kids but they are all very likeable so its hard to hate them
I heard a lot of people in media shit on him and project him to be a poor player is all I'm saying. Silly goose.
This is going over my head, have I missed something?
> Warriors had 2 damn good defenders in Klay and Draymond, and Steph wasn’t a slouch either.

Warriors also had Andre Iguodala, Marreese Speights, Shaun Livingston, Andrew Bogut, David Lee, Harrison Barnes etc.

Depth matters. One of the reasons Warriors fans are optimistic about next season, when Klay comes back, is that while having two seasons effectively lost to injuries sucks absolute balls, the bright side is that it let us rebuild the bench. Bench depth is incredibly hard to maintain during non-stop title runs.
Ye they'd be a top 4 seed with Klay healthy rn I think
Not looking very likely lol
Pretty sure Westbrook would stand up to any player. Guy plays hard AF.
If Gobert would accept that role

one of the issues i have read in Utah last year was Gobert wanted to score more and Mitchell wouldnt pass it to him so there was friction because of it and other issues

i assume it would be the same on the Nets
Does that mean Wall and Boogie are playing better? I've always loved watching them when they were healthy. How funny would it be if every team except the Nets won the Harden trade?
I’m with you on this. Style of play and teamwork matter the most to me.
Dude, thank you, back when he wanted out and there were some vague rumors of trade talks with the blazers I felt like I was the only ripcity fan who *didn't* want to trade for him, for all the same reasons you just mentioned. I'd root for him, but it wouldn't be easy for me.
When the cavs disintegrated, it was fun to watch because you really get to see a lot of amazing games from young talent. Granted 16' was special and  I Wouldn't trade  the memory of screaming "JR LAY THE PIPE" and have him giving finger guns after hitting a 3 for anything. But watching a young team grow is fun even if it doesn't always end in a championship.
Day 1 hater? lmao u ain’t one of us then
I think that moment broke him totally, realizing he is not needed by a team to be successful.
I'd say that honor goes to LeBron and it's not even close. And it's been that way for the last half decade at least.
Him and Nance are definitely the veteran leaders on the team.  Javale has been a nice pick up as well, not only for his energy on the court, but the rest of the guys seem to really respect him. The only thing I am worried about with Love returning is if we can keep up the pace that JB likes to play at. Kevin can't really run the floor very well.
Melo!
i mean that’s all he’s done since 2015
I understood what you meant, man, for that I've added the context that this last season was pretty normal (played 86% of the games and averaged 30+ minutes) despite most comments around (from fans of other teams) kinda making it look like he played 10 games or something, if I had to guess I'd say that people just didn't watch us last year but that's fine too. Anyway, I'm just saying that I feel like things are a bit overblown and, if we are really gunning for the play-ins, that we could expect a pretty ok Kevin Love coming back to play when he is ready. 

And I think that Love is expected to be reevaluated this week, by the way, so let's hope for a smooth recovery and another positive player to our team! It really feels like we are gunning for the play-ins, it has been a fun season.
Kyrie was my favorite player when he was with us
Jarrett allen also Lowkey looks like a sweetheart. He looks so happy to be in Cleveland as well. Take good care of him please!
He was already one of my fave players when he was on the Nets.

It’s a shame star power relegated him to being second to the old shell of deandre jordan lmfao. Im glad he’s on a team that really values him now.
You look at the names at Wolves (in theory: KAT > Allen, DLo > Sexton cause former is an all star, Culver > Garland cause earlier pick; Anthony > Nance cause first pick), and wonder how Cavaliers are so competitive while Wolves are so bad
Kyrie gotta take care of himself first. Nets already trying to take care of him $$$
these "take care" comments are so weird to me
My dad, a bucks fan, brings up tractor traylor like once a year. Very bitterly
My favorite years
Tbf the raptors were also still competitive after kawhi left
When your team doesn’t have a good front office, it’s hard to recover from the moves that seemingly need to be made to appease LeBron. The Cavs have cratered post-LeBron each time because they moved future picks and signed veterans to bad contracts.

Clearly, a competent front office like the Heat can figure out how to recover. What’s exciting for Cavs fans is to see the front office making moves that seem intelligent to build a cohesive team that isn’t totally selling out for contention now.

Then again, we’re only one year removed from Altman’s awful hiring of John Belein, so I’d imagine most fans are really just cautiously optimistic.
The roster was pretty rough with Lebron. He’s just good enough to hide it.
How are we supposed to make sense of that?  The quality of the bench has nothing to do with Irving as a player. As for his play he's a willing passer and an incredibly efficient scorer.

And for what its worth, the bench becomes less important when the playoffs come around.  Rotations shrink and the top players see more minutes, the bench players less minutes.

The dude is daft as fuck, but he can ball with the best of them in this league.
I had no idea. That's unfortunate.
Looks like Shamet has a nerve issue too
>atleast

Not a word. Why do people think it is?
Carl Landry was a good role player, especially for the Hornets and Dubs.
Carl got lucky and peaked at 18ppg in his 3rd season rather than his rookie season
MCW won that ROY basically off the first week of the season
Dude’s almost 37 it was bound to happen eventually.
Women willing to get grabbed by the pussy for him
Not his choice to leave again ....

Yep take dame out and put Luka in there
Yeah I think we could have beaten the spurs in the first round with Kobe and nash. I don't think we get past the thunder without the team actually reaching something close to it's potential though. Everyone healthy, and dwight behaving, yes. But if Kobe has to carry, not happening.
It still hurts. Damn
You take Brian scalabrines name outta your mouth
He will spend if we are winning and could be getting rings (and all the $ that comes with that). 

In the scenario where you’re resigning that whole core to big deals, I think you have to assume we are a finals contender. Otherwise of course you wouldn’t ram yourself into the luxury tax
Not sure, but they were never anywhere near as bad as the nets

They were a gritty, slow paced team. They hadn’t figured out their offensive identity and won with their defense, and that was with no bigs. Their stars were just taking turns scoring that first year.
through the first 20 games of the season the 2010-11 miami heat were 4th in defensive rating and 4th in offensive rating 

[source](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=OFF_RATING&dir=-1&Season=2010-11&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=10%2F27%2F2010&DateTo=12%2F05%2F2010)
They are not better on paper. Wade was a top 5 player at the time and Lebron was Lebron. And Bosh was a much better all around player than Kyrie.
3* decades
lol.. Heat had the best player in the game and (imo) the 3rd or 4th best player in the game, along with a top 20 player who was great at filling in the role he needed to do to help the other two succeed.
6th Man Kyrie
Man I really hope the Heat recover from their slump. They were my favorite team to watch last year in the Bubble.
It's the same joke even if it's not a direct reference.
I like the Simpsons as much as anyone....

...

but no.
I feel like maybe Harden is deferring because he just got there and sees it more as KD+Kyrie's team, but he can definitely replace Kyrie's scoring straight up. I think it's going to come down to who can be efficient on offense with less volume and that may change night-to-night, gonna be interesting on both sides of the ball for them.
Eh when Harden was on the floor tonight without Kyrie he was deferring to guys like Jeff Green and TLC and letting them shoot threes. He was mostly just facilitating, not driving to the rim and being aggressive like we’re used to seeing from him. Maybe he was gassed from the 50 minutes he played Wednesday, but definitely something hampered him tonight. And yes this team was playing defense like they didn’t want to be there, bad body language.
STOP THE COUNT
Lol no hate. Always saw Eric snow as what I would be if I played in the nba all defense avg passing no offense lol. It was just frustrating to watch those teams. Cause it was give the ball to bron and play 4v5 cause snow was  not scoring and Brown wasn't gonna run some advanced offense
Was definitely an Eric snow jab lol
Mike Fratello would like a word with you about who the king is. That dude was doing 81-76 games in the 90s lol.

 [1996-97 Cleveland Cavaliers Roster and Stats | Basketball-Reference.com (basketball-reference.com)](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1997.html)
Imo if they traded Kyrie and kept Allen they walk through the east
Oh, well then he better keep coasting
I mean if I’m completely honest the reason the offense is so lopsided into Kyrie’s favor and not balanced among 3 elite scorers is probably an X’s and O’s thing, and in my opinion when you have 3 scorers who know how to find their shot you should probably have a more defense oriented coach because outside of KD, Kyrie and Harden have never shown indication of solid defensive performances without that extra push from a coach.  

Nash’s quote of “this team doesn’t really need a coach” (paraphrasing) it’s kind of going to get exposed here I feel and if they don’t do something the best the Nets will be until a coaching change is lights out offense that is scoring to not lose.
Giving up easy baskets to the opposing PG (in this case Sexton) reduces a lot of the value of Kyrie's offense. Height has nothing to do with defense Kyrie is giving up points to a guard smaller than him.
The thing is, *someone* on the team needs to play defense. They’re not short on elite scorers, but that’s not enough to win it all.
Oh I don’t think anybody is asking for elite defense from any of these volume scorers.  Some defense would be nice, I’d assume though.
Stat is disrespectful to Steph, dude is mediocre at D because of his size but he give effort and does the best he is capable of. Kylie literally doesn’t give a shit about anything outside of scoring.
Damn Jordan was elite shot blocker not long ago
Again as someone who watched nearly every Cavs game then. The team was much much weaker then. All offensive plays had to be initiated with LeBron
There was a clearly big difference between the 2017 and 2018 cavs lol

2017 - 2nd seed while coasting (Lebron & Kyrie rested several games that year), went 12-1 in arguably Lebron’s most dominant run throught the East during his Finals appearance streak, though not a close series at least took a game against the warriors to lose 4-1

2018 - 4th seed with Lebron playing all 82 games, team even made big changes to their roster midway through the season due to poor performance, struggled through the playoffs at 12-6, including 2 nail-biter 7 game series when the year before they cruised to the finals with no competition, than got swept in the finals 4-0.

I would say there was a pretty clear difference when Kyrie left.
No? If you don’t notice the clear drop after Kyrie left then idk what to tell you
Dude, I think you might be forgetting that was the second year into KD's warrior contract.
To be fair, he's a good team defender though. Plays the passing lanes well also.
Pretty much every stat shows Steph as a league average defender for his position.

Yup, Steph had one bad game and the sports media ran with Delledova being good.
Agreed, of course the loss is not only kyrie’s fault. But he is a large reason, and he will continue to be a concerning factor going forward.
Wtf are you talking about? Don’t think he will get a max, you’ve already talked to much I can tell you’re a big big casual lol
"Just because you were able to throw a bunch of stars together doesn't mean much until you prove it later."

That was what I cited the Clips for. The Clips were rightfully considered a serious threat because they had a combination of star power (2 superstars) and depth (2 6MOY winners). There was no major flaw with their roster that people perceived and they made high seed.

Nets? They haven't got either factor on their side now. We'll see what they do with their roster and how they play from here on. But a real question mark rather than a proven threat.
Lol ok, you’re cute
That would cause absolute chaos
You Know I'm All About Winning (Another) One For The 'Land.
He just wants to ride the Young Bull thru the regular season so he can turn it on again in the playoffs
Lebron's probably got PTSD from carrying Cleveland corpses to the finals every year.
No irony, I'm hoping he comes back again after the Lakers 3peat. It'll be right in time to ride with the young guns
Jarrett Allen and Collin Sexton will torment the Nets for years to come on the Cavs
Put kd on the worst defensive team in the league and literally a 3rd year undersized point guard will match him shot for shot
I figured they just had a slow start. I didn't know y'all were missing half your team lol. It's like when we had only one guard for like 4-6 games this season and we're still in playoff contention. I also don't think the Hawks are gonna make it. Just a hunch of mine that I have no evidence to support
There’s 6 teams I think are locks to make it in the East (Bucks Sixers Celtics Heat Pacers Nets), the likelihood the Cavs don’t make a play in spot between 7-10 is extremely unlikely
>  they literally haven’t had half their roster for more than two games.

We've had this problem too, man, our fans just didn't post as many threads about it. Sexton himself came back in that last game, tonight it was Windler and Garland (on minutes restriction) coming back, so just right now that it seems like we are back to normal.

No COVID cases though, which is nice.
 I guess Kyrie *does* browse reddit.
Everyone recognizes his offensive prowess. 


Nobody cares anymore if it’s not conducive to winning and he does/says stupid shit every few weeks while getting injured annualy.
This is irony.
What's his off the court greatness?

Bailing on his team to go party in Canada or just the flat earth shit?
Scoring isn't going to be the Nets big worry, and Kyrie's one of their weakest defenders but he'll be playing close to the whole game.

That creates a climate for criticism.
Isn’t that what he was doing last week?
For when the Cavs win the championship right? right?
Lol yeah I really detest harden and kyrie but if anyone thinks a superteam is gonna magically play perfectly their first few games they're crazy.
RemindMe! 6 months
RemindMe! in five months.
Remember last year when everyone thought the super short Rockets were suddenly the team to beat for four or five games lol
Why would they mesh?
Here? or literally everywhere? Twitter, instagram, youtube, etc. They all are all the same lol.
Once again, their great speculations turns out to just be dumb overreaction...
lol yeah and they're literally asking him to play the 4 and 5 poor jeff lmao
Jeff Green must have the worst agent in all of pro ball. I know he is on the older side,  but his size and skillset is tailor made for the modern NBA game. Yet year after year he bounces around the league as a journeyman making vet min money while other less productive wings get multiyear contracts.  It is mystifying.
Without looking at stats prior to this year I think his best years might have been with the Celtics? And he was like fine with us, but he wasn’t some amazing talent. I think being not the big 3, but actually useful unlike Jordan, is helping his case a lot
They're already playing playoff minutes
Is Tyler Johnson still on his poison pill contract or did that finally expire?
with what defense?
I respectfully disagree with all of this
FUCK really? dude keep that a secret they might blackball him if they ever find out his single game plus minus was so bad
Landry Shamet went 0/6 and was +6, your point?
This right here
I think Kyrie would have been a better trade piece than the 8 1st round picks/swaps+jarrett allen that they had to give up. Harden is a better scorer and facilitator and defender than Kyrie, so just add a competent big man like Allen and you're basically all set for a strong playoff run.
Yessir. I could hardly watch the rest of the playoffs I was so bitter with disappointment. 

Side note: why is a picture of Kawhi in a Clippers warmup shirt the picture on this thread lol
Where they gave up more points in the paint over any two game stretch than any team in the last 20 odd years.
They reallllly need some depth. This bench unit will not get the Nets far. The ironic part about it all is that Jarrett allen would have been the perfect center for this team.
Yup apparently trading some pretty good players for a perennial mvp candidate is mind boggling to some. This sub shits on players for making comments about their own teams being good for a few games. Then flips to significantly hotter takes based on even fewer games a couple weeks later. Do I think the Nets Big 3 will win a title together? No. Am I going to definitively declare this an awful trade and act like James Harden isn’t elite? Absolutely not. Way too many people in here are nearly as bad as Skip, except they aren’t paid to have bad opinions. They just have them.
James Harden isn’t depth and interior presence. I’m not saying they’re doomed to be .500 at best or that they won’t be great but come on. This trade wasn’t exactly the best
I’ve seen this movie before and Nets fans are not gonna like the ending. This team reminds me of the 2017 and 2018 Cavs teams which pretty much fell apart entirely anytime Lebron sat. Similar situation, big 3 but no bench at all and not good enough defense.
Never trade away core players. Bench or otherwise. It's gonna hurt.
You could end up getting out rebounded by twice your own rebounds while allowing the team you sent some of said players to 147 one night and 125 the next. You  lose depth, which is important. Also, if you have a top 5 player and a top 10-15 player, it’s not quite the best to give up said depth for any single player that isn’t Lebron, Steph, AD, or maybe Giannis
I know what pick it is haha it’s still reasonable. Bc Allen does them zero good this year, and after this year they’ll be paying him what’s likely to be market rate. Unless you have some reason to believe that they’ll sign him to a below-market deal, then a late first is a perfectly reasonable return
He could be, yes. I'm just saying that so far he's been playing center.
Not enough people were talking about Jarrett Allen during the trade discussion. That’s the real get.
Houston wanted another pick and save money. 
You guys took on the contract of Prince and provided another pick. Great deal of the cavs.
Who was TERRIBLE for us lol
Jarret also needs to get paid next year, Cavs can do it due to Drummond leaving, Rockets probably wouldn't want to.
Houston just wanted first round picks so this was a way they could get more.
The Cavs got Allen (+ Prince) for a late 1R pick (+ 2R pick + Exum). 

The Nets then used that 1R pick as one of the four needed to acquire Harden. 

It sure seems like the Rockets could have just gotten Jarrett Allen *instead* of that late 1R pick and simply cut the Cavs out of it completely. They really wanted the picks, I guess, and don't want to pay Allen as a restricted free agent after this season.

I'm not complaining.
I just love the hustle from Sexton on every damn play. He plays like his shorts are on fire and I love it.
Jesus, you’re disgusting. Kyrie’s playing some of the best basketball of his career at the moment (when the chakras and sages align lmao). He got you a ring, be more thankful, LeBron didn’t do it on his own. Sexton’s ceiling is like Boston Kyrie. “kyrie bad karma pls”
If you’re arguing talent wise that you would rather not have Kyrie, yes these dudes are on drugs, but if we’re talking whole package and include the fact that he’s a fucking headache and seemingly could just quit basketball at any given moment, then it’s a debate, and imo, I wouldn’t want him over Sexton, because at least I don’t have to worry about Sexton randomly retiring over some bullshit. Lol
Lmao Jaden Smith of the NBA is such a perfect description. Spits out all sorts of pseudo intellectual weirdo bs.
Yeah it also bothers me when people who have a platform use it to spread bullshit. Kids look up to Kyrie and he’s out there telling them the world is flat and showing how to be a proudly ignorant jackass.
Not OP, but Kyrie crying his way out of Cleveland because LeBron took the shine away from him, then dogging on our city after leaving made me dislike him.
ESPN? The fuck?

He noped out of more chances to win rings because he needed to be the #1 option. And hell, if he had actually gone on to not completely flame out, I’d probably still like him. Leave to be it, then do it? Great. Shit I wasn’t even mad when LeBron left the first time. 

But we’ve all seen how Kyrie’s master plan has worked.
This is the way
Always has been
Gelo is the oldest
He was the 3rd overall pick and has always been considered the best nba prospect of the brothers . Maybe listen to different analysts ?
as a 49er fan... this is a joke in reference to one of the most painful sports memories of my life. 49ers lost to the seahawks in the ultimate rivalry championship game in 2013 and Sherman went on an epic post game rant calling Crabtree a sorry ass receiver. PS that game WAS BUllSHIT BOWMAN RECOVERED THE FUMBLE AND THEY FUCKIN BROKE HIS LEG. fuck the toots is all I have to say. I'd say fuck the sonics too, but I got no beef with OKC :-) :-)

Greatest post game interview of all time.
Everyone forgets that the warriors big three wasn't really the most overwhelming talent wise, they just happened to have the greatest shooting back court of all time, a perfect fit third in draymond with incredible depth. At the time Iggy was only a couple years removed from the all star game and gave them such a premium over other teams 4th guy.
Lol yeah there’s absolutely no chance. But we can dream.
Just as hard as he clanks 3s
Wall has been phenomenal when he’s played though he’s been resting for a few games 

Boogie is bad at everything except shooting threes and rebounding tho which makes me sad

We also have a few young guys that I’m really happy with, being Jasean Tate and mason Jones.

Even Kenyon Martins son has been solid
Wall was out tonight, but when he plays he looks good, considering how long it's been since he played.  Boogie is playing well.  He's not what he once was, but maybe he'll get better... he just needs to get his temper under control.
lol... I'm definitely not a Harden fan.. No hate.  Just boring to watch.

I am one of you as far as the Rockets team goes.  Team above player.
Hating Harden from day 1 makes no sense when our offense was completely different. Under McHale, we were running pick and roll, not completely dependent on 3s, had a strong bid range game, and Harden had a usage rate that was average for a star player on a team. This was even before he started looking for contact instead of finishing shots/plays. 

But r/NBA loves Harden hate especially when it comes from Rocket flairs
That showed all I needed to know about who Kyrie is as a player and person. He cares more about being the central star than winning. He should’ve been excited that his team performed so well. 

Imagine if MJ didn’t come back to the bulls after his first retirement because they almost made the ECF without him.
Imo he is the ultimate floor raiser.  Will drag any lottery team to the playoffs.
*when he’s in the east
Damn, I didnt realize Nance was 28, I coulda sworn he was like 24/25
At least Kevin Love gives you rebounds and all the bench enthusiasm and sex appeal of a soccer dad, what does Melo give you?
Oh it's been super fun. I bet he's excited to get back since they are competitive and he doesn't have to play the 5. I have no idea how JB will handle lineups once everyone is healthy. I'm not used to this much depth.
Same. I remember him absolutely destroying the Celtics in the 4th quarter in his rookie year and knew we had a great one. Just seeing the looks on Pierce, Garnett and Allen’s face told the story. 

Loved every second of him as a Cav.
I don't know if I can even remotely agree with any of this, is it sarcasm? Obviously KAT > Allen but Allen is underappreciated, the guy knows his role and is efficient. Sexton is probably a little better than DLo, he's just more efficient and a better scorer, like yah DLo was a fringe All-Star Reserve once but it's probably more of a wash. Culver isn't even remotely the scorer or playmaker that Garland is, they aren't even the same prototype player. Nance is a much better player than Anthony by like every metric and I'm not sure why you would think a 1st pick as a rookie would necessarily be better than a well-established solid contributor.
This is a pretty inaccurate theory of what makes a successful basketball team tbh, I think the pieces on the Cavs are buying into new coaching and big emphasis on scrappiness and the defensive end which is getting us wins. All the personnel sorta fit into good niches for the Cavs right now, which was a welcome surprise this year. KAT and company are def talented enough to be doing better tho for sure
Yeah big difference between making the Conf. Finals every year without Kawhi and being a lottery team without Lebron.
The reason we won the title was because of this “bad front office”. It’s more like, it’s not a destination place for nba players to want to come and nba players are a bunch of divas. HERE WERE GOOO BROWNIESSS HEREEE WE GO
Shut up nerd.
hey man MS word autocorrects when writing matters. but noted
Definitely agree kyrie isn’t a top 10 player. I would do the swap due to it not being dame time currently. And Steph just reminded everyone he’s the best PG and shooter around
If I only count legal years I am 19
Ha dont worry i was just messing

Also.... I’d be the same player too lol. Loved him anyways. Snow was a good dude. At least they werent a team full of Ricky Davis and Darius Miles anymore by then
At least he can make the mid range shot lol.
And the defense that he brings along with it - and add in him taking so long with his iso that he ices his own team on top of the other team too.
Not just this, but they need more than 3 reliable players. KD is going to play way too many minutes and re-injure himself, and he is there best defender. They need some role players badly
You are already asking too much.
If you account for his size, I actually think Steph is a good defender. He box out and rebound well, he reads out passing lanes for steals and he’s really good at hedging on screen to avoid mismatches.
Yeah, nobody can critique Stephs effort level. With Kyrie, his effort is obviously in question.
Yeah the revisionist history on Kyrie is ridiculous. Sure he's gone a bit mental but he's still a great basketball player.
If not for j.r. Smith the finals in 2018 would have been AT LEAST 4 - 1. So I'd say that in the finals, against the same team, 2017 and 2018 cavs were equal
Bro they tried to hide him on the worst offensive player every game. Steph was always calling for a switch with any guards who could do anything offensively. But yeah I agree media ran with delly
That's exactly why Harden isn't dropping down to 15pts/g, it just doesn't make sense

See man, you used your brain and you got there too! All you needed was my help to get you to the finish line
I agree, but I think hypers and haters need to chill we need more games to make real judgments.
What have the cavs done since 2016? Lmao
Phrasing
🤣that’s a damn long PTSD. Hopefully Bron is feeling better
a 3 peat with lakers and another 1 with Cleveland and he's the GOAT no questions
He's more of a shooting guard when Garland is healthy but still a valid point
Regular season doesn't matter. Think of these games as nfl preseason games.
Seems like a lot of teams are struggling with injuries regardless of COVID.
Because no one other than Kyrie could see the good he does for humanity. It's not like there have been multiple articles written on his humanitarian efforts over the years. Nope only Kyrie can see the good in Kyrie. Holy fuck dude. Pull your head out of your ass and stop being a pathetic hater.
Yea those made great memes. But i was talking about how he donated $1.5 million to help pay WNBA players' salaries during the pandemic, how he donated 250,000 meals to feed people in the New York area during the pandemic, and the whole other list of things he's constantly done for charity throughout his entire career. But yea...those don't really make for great memes I guess 🤷🏾‍♂️
Obviously, what else could he possibly be implying?
Saved
You upset the Nets and We'll upset the Lakers and we'll have a fun finals all to ourselves with no KD or LeBron.
The odds seem to be stacked against them even if they end up meshing perfectly. Their bench is shallow as shit, and they look weak defensively. And they’re one injury away from oblivion. It’ll be interesting to see how they do over the season with all that potentially working against them.
RemindMe! 5 Months
They wouldn't, at least entirely. James Harden and Kyrie have both gone through several superstar teammates to still only be unhappy. Idk why people are acting like that's going to change.
Reddit's overreactions can be pretty wild tbh. Like at least in other platforms a lot of them seem to be trolls.
Same shit different year for Green. They had him playing the 4 almost exclusively at OKC if memory serves.
Last year on the rockets he was playing small ball 5. uncle Jeff can handle it
I'm really not sure he's gonna make it to the playoffs at this rate
He really doesn't produce over the whole year. He is good then bad then good then bad. He ends up being a league average player at best. His stint with the Rockets was probably his best offensive production of his career
If you watch him play for a year, you'll understand why.
Such a good point. His agent’s name is Jason Glushon and the list of other players he represents or once did is interesting - Joe Johnson, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Jaylen Brown are his 4 big contracts all over $100 mil. He also represents Dinwiddie who just signed that $32 mil Bitcoin contract. All his other clients look to be vet min guys but hard to believe he never got Jeff Green paid more.
Without making a multi-para post about why I think the Harden trade was a good idea, I'll just compare it to the Lakers-AD one, and point out that Harden's even better than him.
Kyrie went 14/24 for 38 points and was -11
Well than you are consistent and I can fuck with that opinion. I’m a casual Sixers fan and I’d have been pissed if they did Ben + tisse + Maxey as well.

I have no clue, Harden for Kawhi trade incoming
Especially if they match up with the cavs in the playoffs
Yeah but Allen had to be moved for James harden who's levels and levels above allen
It's a weird trade though. You should take your shot to get Harden every single time it comes up. Having KD, Kyrie, and Harden is something that you can only dream of come playoff time. On the other hand, they gave up their young, talented center in a conference with a lot of big man talent. In the playoffs they will face at least one of: Bucks (Giannis, Lopez), Magic (Vuc), 76ers (Embiid), or the Heat (Bam). They have 0 interior defense for that, and I don't know of any assets they have to bargain with by the deadline. Embiid might just eat them alive. It looks like they have cornered themselves into a glass cannon approach where they need to just score a million points. I cannot blame them for getting Harden, but it's tough to say whether it was the right move for their championship aspirations.

Edit: forgot about the Pacers with Sabonis
You absolutely do this trade 100 times out of 100. However, this team won’t get far at all with the current unit. Marks needs to fill out the roster with defensive bigs for there to even be a fighting chance.
The thing is, Harden is elite.

But bad things happen when you have *elite starters* and *no goddamn bench*.

Look at the Warriors in 2019. And they had more than 3 good players.
It's been 3 games. We don't know yet if it was the right move or not. If they pick up a center on the buyout market, and win the title then you will look real dumb. Let's give it more than 3 games, that's all.
The 2017 Cavs absolutely win the title if the Warriors didn't have the greatest team of all time. The 2017 Cavs were incredible, and if the Nets can be that good they at least make the finals, probably win.
If this is your take you shouldn't be a GM
How tf were they going to get harden without including levert or allen in any way. The only option left would be an injured Dinwiddie
Lakers?
I mean I feel they could have gotten better than a late first for Allen.
Them damn free throws...
That makes such a difference.  He's not a perfect player but his team is not gonna be out worked.
Lmao I love Kyrie and am incredibly grateful for the ring. More than I could explain.

That said he demanded a trade and it worked out well for us. You gonna sit here and act like 2016 Kyrie isn’t the best we’ve seen from him since?
What’s disgusting is some superstar athlete acting like he can’t treat his coworkers with some common decency and using his platform to reference antisemetic conspiracies. Sexton is a hard worker and been nothing but great for our young team. It’s so nice to not have to root for an idiot or deal with bullshit. You can Stan for him all you want, been there done that never again please.
Sure his numbers are up, but it's a small sample size AND that squad is supposed to be an offensive juggernaut. Too early to say how good he's doing. 

Personally I think he's peaked because he doesn't act like he'll ever buy into a team system again. It seems like every year since Cleveland he does something that pisses off his teammates. That's bad for team chemistry.
Best basketball of his career? Dudes only played two games this year
You know there's a thing called defense right
they told you to hate him, way to go boy! Don’t format the sentence like it’s your damn opinion when you’re literally just repeating the same thing you’ve heard on the TV over and over and over again.
Yeah, wonder if you’re holding yourself to the same standards lmao it’s top 1 in the business or bust. Fuck outta here with that shit, you’re trying to reason with yourself, but I bet you’ve never thought about it until now. You sure as hell hated, cause there was someone out there shaping your opinions, and now that you’re challenged to use your rusty ass mind you’re struggling to come up with something that makes sense. “I wouldn’t have hated him if he just became the best player in the world” yeah no shit creative genius, you and everyone else are in that boat.
Yes
This is the way
Lonzo actually the oldest
>  I'd say fuck the sonics too, but I got no beef with OKC :-) :-)

I nearly spat out my wine lmao
Don't worry, he only called him a sorry receiver, not a sorry-ass receiver.
Fuck the toots. That play is less painful knowing that sherm is on the niners now. Don’t even get me started on last years super bowl
The fact that this other dude thinks “the big three” of the warriors are even comparable to the big three of the nets is a fucking joke. If you compare curry to kyrie then that means you’re comparing thompson and green to freaking durant and harden. That warriors squad was in sync and everyone mattered. This nets squad will be carried by their 3 or lose.
Rims hate him
Boogie playing well is lol. He has no offensive game and can’t keep up with anyone that can jump on defense.
Bruh we’d be nothing these past nine years without him! Idk how you lasted a fan then. Dude was literally the team
The first year of D’Antoni Harden was dishing like crazy. Tons of ball/player movement. Eventually Harden got his way and became watch him dribble the clock out and jack up step back 3’s. Chris Paul comes in and actually brings chemistry and accountability(resulting in the best shot in Harden’s run). But again Harden’s ego runs him off, forcing a trade for Westbrook, who also couldn’t stand playing with Harden’s complete lack of professionalism and accountability. This dude ran this franchise into the ground then left. Screw Harden.
*finals
So is Lebron the best ceiling raiser or is it KD? And I don’t doubt that KD can carry a team, but we haven’t seen him have to do that since  what, his MVP season?
It’s because he was a 4 year college guy. He came into the league at the same time as KAT and Porzingis but was already like 22 at the time
Jab steps
Clutch time points and good defense on exactly 4 possessions per season
For all of you!!!
>  I have no idea how JB will handle lineups once everyone is healthy. I'm not used to this much depth.

Same! Anyway, as Garland shouldn't have minutes restrictions moving forward, I'd say that Okoro moves back to the 3 so Garland can come back at the 1, Cedi can move back to the bench where he is most likely more efficient and better used primarily at the 3, so at that point we'd have:

Consistently starters | Consistently 1st lineup with players off the bench
--- | ---
Garland |
Sexton |
Okoro | Cedi
Nance | Love
Drummond | Allen


With every other piece being way more flexible than those, plenty of players could cover plenty of positions but I feel like those will be the most common combinations.
Forgot about that moment, kudos
Hence why I said 'in theory' or perhaps the better way to put it was 'on paper'.


I fully agree with you that Sexton is better. Wolves just drafted and constructed their team so poorly.
Not to mention how dark things got the first time Bron left.
Yeah, I would agree with that. Cleveland a NOT a destination in the NBA, and I doubt it ever will be. I suppose selling out for a star player in the NBA, no matter the market, is just the cost of doing business in a league where the players have so much control.

I think the Brownies should have an easier time courting top talent this summer, if they choose. BLESS’EM
Ok ifyousayso.
Haha so true
Eh I don’t know, it’s not like he has an open layup, KD was right in front of him.
You mean like how every team has their go to offensive player hide on the other teams worst player(if positions allow it)?

Lebron hides on dudes who barely dribble all the time.
the hell you're talking about lol. harden will be 33 or 34 by the time his contract is up no ones gonna max harden at that point lmao
Well, made it to the finals sans Kyrie...and then beat his Nets twice this week, time will tell for the rest. How many times he been to the finals without Lebron and the Cavs? Also, the earth is round, does that make sense to you?
Is this why they call it sexland?
That shit sticks man.
Such a high standard🤣. Be gentle plz, two more rings (hopefully 2FMVPs), he’s indisputable GOAT along with those unbreakable records
Maybe if you’re Lebron they don’t matter lmao. But try telling that to the organization that sold their future for a superteam that is currently struggling for a playoff spot because it keeps losing to a teams that are rolling out rookies in their starting lineups and backup wings at shooting guard

See how they react
I think the cavs literally started their bench a few days ago though. You can’t compare other teams to that.
Chill bro, I'm just playing.
How gross, the idea of 'buying' the perception of being a good person. You bringing this up shows that he - does-know what is expected of him in society he's just intentionally irresponsible.

It's actually worse because he can act like a decent person but chooses not to.
RemindMe! 4 months
Kyrie and James Harden the past how many years is an overreaction?
u right, i think im underestimating him a little
AD plays defense, so I think he’s leagues better than a guy who isn’t worth shit unless the ball is in his hands
So we agree that +\- is the most pointless basketball stat?
Sixers are my east coast team, great game today. I’m Aussie so I’m a big Ben Simmons fan. 

But no way Ballz trades his megastar for James Harden.

Edit: Tisse is my boy. That smile. That damn smile...
The weird thing is that he was moved for a mediocre pick. It's really odd that they couldn't get a shitty pick without giving him away.
You’re absolutely right.
I do wonder whether the deal could have been done if Dinwiddie was healthy though.
Rim protecting centers don’t grow on trees. Just ask the Clippers when the brought in Joakin Noah last year thinking that was going to help somehow.
Laker bias aside as I'm a lebron fan, I believe the current lakers would beat that 2017 cavs team. So not entirely sure about the probably win part in thay hypothetical
Yeah, the Lakers shouldn't have traded for AD in that case. Just don't win the title I guess.
Hey and my feelings aren't hurt by that! Da fuck do GM's do but fuck up! This is why the Nets lost that trade
The answer is easy: don’t trade for Harden. Let someone else gut their roster for him.
I get what your saying, but losing Levert and Allen was huge. All I'm saying. Maybe you stick with what you have. Irving and Durant hadn't even gotten the chance to gel with what that team. IMO I think they could've made it work wo Harden. JMO
But you have to understand that in reality it’s actually just the rest of this season worth of Allen, plus his restricted rights. One season of a good but not elite center is not worth much. Restricted rights to a good but not elite center are similarly not worth much. A late first is perfectly reasonable in exchange for Allen.


Who is going to give up more than a late first for him? If you’re a team trying to make a contention push and want him for this year, then you’re likely going to have a late pick. If you’re a team with a high pick, that means that you’re likely not trying to make a push for this season. That means you’re not going to want Allen unless you just really want the chance to sign him in RFA. And if the only part of the equation you’re interested in is the right to give a center a market-rate contract, then *you’re* not gonna want to give up much for him either.


There’s simply just not any conceivable way they could’ve gotten anything more for him. Even on this deal, part of the return for Cleveland was getting off of exum’s contract. So in reality they valued Allen at *less* than a first. 



Centers grow on trees, man. Unless you’ve got an elite guy, it makes zero sense to sink assets into the position.
He was so good in the finals. LeBron was LeBron, but Kyrie was playing way above what anyone expected - it was awesome to see even with as much as it hurt.
I know that the r/nba introduced the death penalty for saying anything other than KYRIE BAD. You having Sexton over Kyrie has nothing to do with basketball. Media made the choice for you. I love the young bull, and I sure as hell ain’t a kyrie stan but the dude’s a magician.
KYRIE BAD GIVE KARMA ESPN TELL ME KYRIE BAD I SAY KYRIE BAD I GET KARMA

Get help
So you think it's impossible for the media to have a reasonable take on anything, ever? You seem like the type of dude to watch conspiracy theories on youtube and call it research.
You are a psychopath, bud.
Always has been
Gelo got that middle child syndrome
Shiiit really
You know it’s funny. When I was quoting it in my head originally I thought he said sorry ass as well. But he obviously didn’t
True.
That's exactly the problem. One man was the team. You can't win that way.
I'm a fan of the Rockets. There's always a chance guy on the team may not be my favorite, but Rockets are my team.
I mean he only said he didn’t like Harden and his style. I was a fan of him because he made the rox relevant, but he never seemed to have that full devotion the greats have. The clubs literally have kept the dude from becoming legend status.
You're right.
Dude, just say you dont watch the rockets and move on. 

&#x200B;

MDA's first year the rockets were very good, but there was no "eventually Harden got his way" because after finishing with the third best offense in MDA's first year, CP3 joined the Rockets the second year. That and the addition of PJ Tucker and Harden buying in on defense jumped the Rockets even higher. The third year, CP3, Eric Gordon, and Capela all missed significant time forcing Harden to go on The Ungaurdable Tour. I'm sorry you think he was better off letting Austin Rivers, Kenneth Farid, and James Ennis take those shots instead (since they started games in place of the injured starters). Finally, after CP3 was dealt for Westbrook, which was never given a chance do to a unique bubble tournament, Westbrook wasnt able to get into the flow with the Rockets. He then demands a trade because of the culture when he has no friends except for Spalding. Harden sees the Rockets have no chance at winning and demands a trade. From that point on he did act unprofessional but to act as if Harden ran this franchise into the ground, you aren't just wrong, but completely oblivious to the real world.
Kd is the best ceiling raiser imo Bc of his ability to iso, lebron is the best floor raiser that can drag any shit team to the finals
and pump fakes.
I got you, I think we just have different theories like I laid out. I will say I would expect the Timberwolves to be doing better like you said, but I think a lot of the credit for the Cavs so far goes to their coach and system. And their GM obviously constructing the vision.
Then why giannis win dpoy and ad second lmao?  Why was PG a dpoy candidate with okc? KD guarded LeBron with the warriors. Sure these players don't guard the best player the whole game but they don't beg for a switch if they're on them. And late in the game, they do defend them. 

Steph is no doubt one of the best but defense is a weak point.
Yeah, personally, I'm already on the .50-.50 fence. If they win one this year OR next, I'll probably put him ahead of MJ. But I don't think there's an argument at all if LeBron gets to 6 or 7 chips.
I would be surprised if he won fmvp this year but he's surprised me before so I'm not betting against it
For a team with KD and Harden, these games really don't matter. The nets need 20 games to find their groove. Give then time. When they start clicking you'll realize what you're saying now is prisoner of the moment nothingness.  EDIT: a good way to think about it is KD and LeBron are at similar levels so it doesn't matter for both.
You could. Like I said, quite a few teams are struggling. It's not a contest.
No, but it’s only been 3 games though
it’s a valid point though. They need big bodies. Losing Allen was huge
Harden's apparently much better on offense, though, probably in part b/c AD is more reliant on teammates setting him up.  I watched about half the Lakers games last year; LeBron was easily the better player, and he's past his prime.  Harden's RPM has historically been a fair bit higher than AD's.
Kyrie scored a bunch but is basically an open lane on defense. That line is expected
I think it’s a tossup between the two teams. AD is the biggest mismatch since he could just bully K. Love or Tristan in the paint. However, if kyrie’s hot (2016 finals), he’s a huge issue and the Lakers gaurds arnt the greatest defenders. Definitely would be a good series
You are reacting to 2 games, and KD was out, chill.  Every GM would have made this trade
Allen has a chance to be an elite center though, still 22
It’s so crazy the way people jump through hoops online to fake like they care about shit that they definitively don’t irl
The thing is, I think he had that with the Celtics. The previous season everyone was talking about how good their team chemistry was. Enter Kyrie. They looked worse after trading him for IT. They turned into a hot mess with Kyrie throwing his team under the bus to the media multiple times. 

It really made me give more respect to LeBron. I think he covered up a lot of Kyrie's weaknesses by being the ultimate team player.
[removed]
Ohhh there it is, the breaking point. Hit me with the no u. Expected at least a little life outta you, tbh. Turn down that TV boy, you know that momma doesn’t like when SAS yells like that!
The hell, we lucky we got any wins. You should be more of a Morey hater then.
Giannis is the prime example of hiding him on the less effective of the PF or C so he can roam.

AD is not the primary option on offense.

PG on OKC wasn’t the primary option either.

KD wasn’t either, Steph was the engine of the offense. 

Also Steph begging for a switch is a joke. No shit if he gets matched onto Lebron he’s going to do his best to get another teammate to switch with him.
He’s clearly coasting now to save more energy for the playoffs and big moment. Being Strategical/calculated like LeBron🤣 I think he knows this is his best chance to decorate/fmvp his legacy this season
Have any of them started their bench yet?
I don’t care that Harden is better on offense because that’s literally all he’s good for. I’m fine with AD not being that good offensively when he makes up for it with his defense, because Harden isn’t giving you nearly the same production on that end of the floor by comparison.
Is Schroder really not considered a good defender? Also thought kcp and caruso were pretty good based on the eye test. I dont think our defense at the guard spot is a hole for us at all, we struggle more with wing defenders.
You’re missing the point. He’s not an elite center *currently*, and after this year, he’s going to be paid a market rate. He wasn’t gonna win anything for the rockets this year, so having him under contract doesn’t do much for them. And after this year, they’d be paying him his market rate—which by definition doesn’t provide any excess value either. Unless you’re *really* confident that Allen is going to be underpaid in RFA, then he simply wasn’t worth much on the trade market. Houston did absolutely fine to get a late first for a rental of a non-elite player at the most replaceable position in basketball.



Edit: lmao to the people downvoting this—if they could’ve gotten so much more than a late first for half a season of Allen, why didn’t they?
And now you’re stalking my comment history.
You have spent too much time angrily telling someone what they think. Over their preferences. 

Jerk off, smoke one, do whatever you need to get yourself right. You look like an ass and you sound like you have emotional issues.

“The breaking point” lol yeeeeesh guy
You sound really dumb.
I agreed that stars do that in the beginning of games. That being said, Giannis is really good at roaming and he does pick up other stars late in game. 

AD averaged 1 less shot and 1 more point that LeBron. PG averaged same amount of shots and 5 more points than Russ. KD and Steph had almost identical PPG and a fluctuation of about 2 shots. These are 1A and 1B situations if anything.

I am a fan of Steph but cmon hes a bad defender. He calls for switches when guarding opposing point guards.
Harden's become a plus-defender the last few years, according to multiple metrics, if your impression of his defense is the Shaqtin era.  He's been the better player the last few years.  There's a reason AD never won anything until teaming with another superstar.
Schroders biggest flaw is that he sucks on defense. KCP and Caruso do play good defense, but they won’t be able to guard kyrie efficiently.
[removed]
btw good shit with redditcares, I fucking died when that popped up. Cheers
There’s a picture floating around from last night of Sexton going up for a layup while Harden seems to meekly be moving out of the way, so I don’t know where this “improved defense” is
I mean agree to disagree I guess? I haven't seen anyone complain about him defensively this year or last year. He's being praised as a high level defender. Have you maybe not paid much attention to him in the last 2 years as it seems he's improved on that end alot. 

Here's a thread as a secondary source: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/f0ygue/will_schröder_start_being_perceived_as_an_elite/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I didn't watch the game, but his BPM and dRPM the last few seasons are positive, if I recall.  He got 4 steals in his first Nets game.
He/him bitch ass
That’s exactly why I put it. To trigger snowflakes like you. Glad it finally paid off.
And at least don’t be such a coward that you delete the comment about my wife.
Of course I won’t. Imagine calling someone a snowflake with that in your description.
WHO IS GIVING UP 3 FIRST ROUNDERS FOR AARON GORDON?
So many missed open 3s in that 4th quarter for the Nets. Shows that this team can have bad shooting nights, everyone outside of Kyrie was awful
Never gonna get that 1 seed lol
I guess Aaron Gordon realized the trade deadline is this week
Damn, that rim was not having it for us tonight. 

Orlando shot tremendously. GG
Wtf I love the Magic now
Lol @ everyone thinking we were going in a 19 game losing streak.

Lol jk I kinda thought so too, but this team fights every night.
Listen, first place isn’t for everybody
Thank you Magic, very cool!
the 3 point shooting in this game was dumb af
Looked like the Bricklyn Nets out there
Are the 3 other Magic fans that watch that 4th quarter ok because that was nuts
Shoutout to Process Sixer Chasson Randle
This was the flukiest game ever haha. Aaron Gordon with the shooting performance of his career. Evan Fournier couldn’t miss. When the Magic got tight in the 4Q the Nets missed so many open threes down the stretch to make it a tie game. Vuc, Fournier and Gordon came up big with some plays to put it away, even though the Magic kept on turning it over.
Nobody on the Nets could hit open shots. Kyrie was lethal but damn our 3 ball wasn’t falling.
Nice
The Nets bleed! The Nets bleed!

Nice performance by Gordon and Fournier.
Those early fouls on Harden, and Nash choosing to play DJ more than Clax really messed us up at the start.

Hats off to the Magic though.. that was an insane shooting performance.
Uncle Drew 2: Caspers’ revenge
The shots just didn't want to fall, would have been a great comeback win
Magic 21/40 from 3

Nets 10/37


Ouch
Gordon hit career high seven three's and most of them were pretty well contested. Meanwhile Joe Harris missed so many of open threes. tough loss but its ok, onto the next!
Gordon was solid down the stretch.. but can i just say when he turned it over with 28 seconds left, and then just gave up and didn't even run to contest Harden or Harris for three which could have made it a 5 points game.. that was really off putting
Nice
GG magic, I see y’all made a pack with the 76ers to keep us out of The one seed😡😡
Well deserved. Nets choked their chances away in the 4th quarter by missing so many open 3's.
So many bricks in that 4th, from both teams too.
AG giving us Magic fans hope that he'll make the jump with this game. 

It's been tempting to believe that his shooting is improving with a career high in shooting and 2nd highest 3pa per 100 possesions in his career.
Honestly I love this team man
Props to magic y'all executed. Why j gotta wait till Sunday to watch my guys again man
Magic had likely their best shooting game of the season and we had likely our worst shooting game of the season.

 Aaron Gordon was hitting contested stepback 3s while Joe Harris, a man shooting 50% from 3, couldn't hit a wide open 3.

 Just one of those games, it happens.
Bad shooting night for us... Might as well get those ones out of our system now rather than later. Gg Orlando
Is that the best game of AG’s career? Unreal game from him.
AG's trade value just went up
give harden and harris a day off nets, please.
Eh I know we lost and I got fucking frustrated tonight slamming the wood table in shit but it's something that i can get hammered and still these guys make me happy af
You can run but you can't hide. 0.5 games behind still arrives to consume you
The Magic shot 40 threes and had a better chance making a 3 than a 2...don't know how you can beat that if you're not putting in 1000% tbh
Just super cold from downtown. It was bound to happen sometime. Great looks from our shooters, just missed them. GG Magic.
[deleted]
I think it's literally impossible for us to lose the 1 seed at this point.
Fuck the tank baby we’re going to the finals
Brick city is the best way to describe this game


If even half the 3's we shot in the final 5 mins went in Nets could have won. 

All the shooters were cold this game
It’s a bit freaky how bad the Nets are against bottom tier East teams
A Net is actually a being that is physically incapable of obtaining the 1 seed
Don't trade Aaron Gordon.  Don't trade Vuc.  Shop that bum Mo Bamba instead.  Imagine watching this game and thinking that AG is the problem that needs to go.  If he's traded it just proves the FO wants to purge everything from the old regime and doesn't care about quality young players.
Death. 

Taxes. 

The Nets being .5 games behind the Sixers
Thanks Magic Bros, it’s been a good night for Sixers fans

Also, AG and Fournier trade values go brrrr
SIXERS 1ST SEED LIVES ON THANK YOU ORLANDO
I’m not even mad lol
magic hahah
Nice.
Sixers stay on top.
BRICKLYN
The almighty nets are beatable.
Deandre Jordan is fucking trash.
Thanks for looking out for us, Magic.
But Harden is MVP, LOL

He's not even top 2 on his team
What a weird game
Wtf I was told the Nets were unbeatable and were going 16-0 in the playoffs
LOL LET’S GOO
Hey nets hope you enjoyed being 1b for a few hours.
Brooklyn "Allergic to the 1 seed" Nets
Nice
Nice.
Goodnight and enjoy your 2nd seed nets.

- Sixers Fan
Nice
Kyrie Irving with 43 points on 19/31 shooting and a thicc -11 lmfao
The Orlando Magic are my heroes.
Irving is playing for himself
Good shit magic. Nets some bums fr lol
Nice
Nice
Nice
Nice
Nice
If anyone tells you the Nets defense isn't horrible just remind them that they let Aaron Gordon drop nearly a 40 piece on them
Aaron Gordon is my point guard
Joe choked
What can you do when the Magic turn into the Monstars
I think they missed 10 open threes in the fourth
The magic couldn’t miss tonight. Good game
If they had shot 3s at the same % it would have been a 20-pt blowout by Brooklyn
Glad the Magic waited one more night to break their losing streak
Claxton is such a difference maker on the defensive end. Kid should be starting and playing the most minutes at the 5 every night.
Fournier: I meant to do that
Guess after Frank gave the keys to the handcuffs gordan went off.
I'd like to know how many players have their season high against Nets.
Getting Traded Nice
69 

nice
Nice
The only real win us Magic fans get from this is we hope someone trades high for them. We are supposed to be tanking and we can't even do that.
Damn I really hope AG develops his outside game more. AG AND LAVINE duo when
Ernie made a 69 joke tonight in his March madness coverage. Wish I could post the clip but I think it went under the radar.
Never thought Id see the day Joe Harris would shoot below 50% from 3
Missed opportunity to say Fournier and Gordon combined for 69
Nice
Nice
Damn James harden going 4-16? He’s been getting a lot of praise for doing the same thing he did in Houston smh
Also Dwayne Bacon sucks.  Imagine closing with him over Chuma or even Chasson freaking Randle.
Nice.
Nice
Gordon and Fournier's trade value just skyrocketed lol
better

Bol Bol
Bro could not miss. Props
Only 3?
This is not allowed why are u guys winning ,how can we Trade for aaron
I don't understand how the Magic have such a bad record. Aaron Gordon and Vuc are very good players.
Nuggets were about to give 2x
That's why KD is the ultimate cheat code. Even tonight, he'd probably have been enough to win it.
It was the combo of a terrible shooting night with the magic hitting 21 3s. Two every unlikely events but it happens props to magic
Death 

Taxes

Nets being 0.5gb out of 1st seed
Sixers still have some hard games coming up without Embiid but yeah being extra cautious with player injuries makes it really difficult.
the one seed? We may never win a game again.

eat_pray_thug hard as a brick right now
Don’t need it
staying alive past the second round > 1 seed
Wow a actual nets fan?
I’ll remember a 76ers fan not absolutely ripping the Magic for the rest of my life
imagine a team going on a 19 game losing streak hahahahahaahah awful
ight this is funny xD
The Nets have been #2 in the division so many times it's so frustrating, especially because they beat or ended up further than the division winner a few times too...has to be destiny for the Nets to never win a division, we don't have any NBA chips so we hang division banners but we're denied even that lol
Some teams can’t handle the pressure.
Have it.
Those damn Bucks are creeping tho
You're welcome. Payment is sending us Thybulle for Fournier. Thanks.
This is the nba now.
Those first couple of minutes looked like the ultimate tank race.
I watched the whole game. Fournier plays so well every time I watch the Magic.
Joe Harris, the 50% 3pt sniper missed 5 legit wide-open 3s. Jeff Green also missed a wide open corner 3 and Shamet also had an off night too. Shit was ridiculous to watch.
This wasn’t a fluke. It was the sequel for Uncle Drew; Caspers revenge
We tied a franchise record for 1st half threes with 13.
Its becoming so obvious that Clax should start and finish and DJ should be a second option. 

Clax looks like he has so much potential for greatness
Scrolled waaaay to long to find this.
for future reference, it's "pact"
It was a thank you for Vooch game
Yes the Nets are better than the Magic, we don’t need justification lol
This feels like dude is trying to convince himself not to flip out lol
This always such a weird comment after games like this, like yes if they're making that many it's hard to win but most of the time they're only making that many to begin with because defense is lacking
Nice
nice
Don't it's a trap.
50 percent from 3 is a good stat but you make it sound like the it's easy lol
You know you're bad when you beat the nets
The Nets last made the 1 seed in 2002.
You can have the 1st seed, we’ll settle for the east
The problem is how do you pay him and vuc and Isaac together
Then you'll be an 8 seed forever
cant blame this one on kyrie, he was literally the only one that actually played good
Are you saying Kyrie wasn't good or that the +/- stat doesn't mean much ?
the deandre jordan effect
He’s a plus negative defender so that’s not shocking reminds me of game 3 in the 2017 nba finals
spoken like someone who didn’t watch the game for a single second
Ha that's the sex number
Have you not seen how many injuries we've had
Aaron Gordon has been out half the year, along with 3 other starters
Vuc is the only one who's been injury free all year, Anthony, Gordon and Fournier have barely played, Isaacs and Fultz are out for the whole season, the rest of the cast has all had various injuries and missed games. It's basically been Vuc alone all season, which has been great for his value but terrible for our record.
Gordon being out for 6 weeks might have a little something to do with it.
the ultimate luxury
While KD would've been enough to win, him being a cheat code isn't the reason why. Like the OG comment said they missed a lot of open 3s, so being a 7ft who can shoot over anyone wouldn't really matter.
But should you need KD, Kyrie AND Harden to beat the Magic?
“Probably”?? U guys lost by 8
As he has been for the past couple years
bad defense too, horrible coverage on Vucci Mane in general. Too much switching and no hedging, lack of quality double teams, inability to rotate and closeout on the perimeter
Seriously this is the story of the East this season.
Lol at everyone disregarding the Bucks while being 1 game behind
Good luck with that
Huh
I mean we're intertwined now. You have Sixers legend Markelle Fultz and we have a guy that didn't quite work out for you but found a new home here in Dwight Howard
You guys usually beat us lol
You must not know of the legend FultzShoulder then.

Edit: I forgot Colangelo changed his flair to Nets 😂
Always a sweet spot for the magic in my heart. When I lived in Orlando for a few years in 2010-2014, I enjoyed getting the deal where it was $20 for two tickets and two hot dogs
We all know the Bucks will end up in the 1 seed and there isn’t anything we can do about it lol
Couldn’t be us
Thanks, I will
This + recently winning against the 76ers + the Heat losing tonight is really flattering us
They are gonna get the 1st seed. It's inevitable.
sheesh since when were they a game and a half back
I thought that fournier corner three off the side of the backboard was the tank starting up its engine
Harden was also 2-8 from three
Did Shamet really have an “off day” though
I scrolled far enough that I thought about posting it just because I felt *someone* had to, and I never do that.
Nah he speaking facts they had so many open threes that 4th but they just couldn't knock them down
I know bad games happen every once in a while. If we do this a few times in a row i'll flip out
Our best 3 point shooter, who happens to be the best shooter in the league currently, missed 2 wide open shots to possibly tie/take the lead and this is after the magic FINALLY went cold to start off the 4th

Incredibly unbelievable night lol
Better than missing the playoffs every year hoping to draft the next great savior.
[deleted]
No, I don't follow the team. I guess that makes sense though.
I hope Cole gets to play soon.
But KD isn't the type of player who lives and dies by the 3, he always has his midranges when his 3 isn't falling.
Vuc might be the best floor raiser this season in the NBA after Harden. They aren't a free win and it's not all gleaguers either.
when you have an off game like that and the opposition plays one of their best games of the year then yeah
We had breakdowns but Aaron Gordon literally hit 5 step back 3s
sorry can't hear you from up here
Y'all gave us Vuc in the Dwight trade 😎
Didn't quite work out? Probably /s here but he did take them to the finals.
We’re just built different.
Never doubt the 2x reigning regular season champions 😤
Nah, they only barely beat us when we were on the 2nd of a b2b without embiid.
this is more of a normal thing lately
Fair enough. Not really, but he did miss a crucial momentum bucket for the Nets in the fourth, and it was a fairly wide open 3pt look too. It was just the story of the game for the Nets.
He's actually been decent recently
You don't have to look further than DJ's abysmal defense to see why. Magic were straight-up abusing the switch onto him .
joe harris was a +11 and this was his worst game of the season, shooting 3-13

im assuming you didnt watch the game
For a few weeks I had to Google their entire starting lineup outside of vuc lmao
My point was KD can't make players hit wide open 3s. They would've won w/ KD, but they also could've won w/o him.
For sure, I don’t mean to say the magic are trash, but it’s pretty bad if you’re saying that the nets *need* KD to win when you have Kyrie and Harden on your team. That’s 3 all NBA players
And you all gave us Tobias (plz ignore the other 12 stops for the purposes of this bit)
yeah lol it's sarcasm, the joke being Dwight is a Magic Legend and Markelle is a guy who didn't work out for philly but found a new home in Orlando
The Fake 1 Seed is the Bucks by rite
Honestly, I'll take it considering we were down 19 and endured our worst shooting half of the Budenholzer era. You guys are still a good team without Embiid and I was amped we found a way to claw back.
We didn't even have PJ Tucker bro
Or they came back from 19 down with a poor shooting performance and  a clutch Giannis. Perspective
He was also atrocious at the rim, which he’s still been decent at recently
Joe Harris didn't constantly make defensive mistakes.
Fake fan doesn’t know Gary Clark and Chasson Randle smh /s
You actually googled Fournier?
My point is that on nights where the entire team is off from 3, KD will still score and not just be another player jacking up 3s. 

Like how Kyrie was only ok from 3 today but still scored 43 from slashing and pull up jumpers inside.
No one was arguing that they couldn't have won with out him. They were saying with the team on a cold streak KD still could have got them the win bc the man has too many options to be/stay cold.
Don't apologise just because Embiid got injured. Did opposing teams' fans apologise to the Bucks fans when we went 0-5 after Jrue got Covid? Suns fans were rubbing it in as if they beat the Durant Warriors lmao. Embiid gets injured every year, big deal
either way it tells you a lot about both teams retaliative strength when you take injuries out of the equation.
Chasson Randle, QC stand up
Do NOT google Fournier medical issues
He’s been injured half the season too lol. For a large portion we had 4 starters out, along with more than half the bench

edit: fuck lol went over my head
never google that
They weren't jacking up 3s for the most part (except Harden tbh), Harris alone had 3 or 4 wide open 3s in the 4th, there's no scenario where he doesn't shoot those regardless if KD is playing or not.

So KD could've bailed them out w/ his midrange shots - but if you keep generating wide open 3s for your borderline 50% 3 pt shooter,  I think they would've let him keep shooting.
That's basically what I said in my first comment, KD could've bailed them out but if a team is generating wide open 3s for their elite 3 point shooters, they're going to want them to shoot them.
I'm not apologizing. I'm simply acknowledging that they obviously aren't at their best without their MVP candidate star player. And it's not like the Sixers are some lottery team without him. It was still a hell of a comeback by the Bucks considering how awful we were in the first half.
Thats not how the regular season works
Embiid is probably never going to have a full season so you just have to bake that in when making predictions. Sorry, but someone had to say it
Why do I have to do this to myself
How long has Chuma been back? I'm an Auburn fan and was so excited to see him in the NBA. How's he looked?
Yeah but KD would still take away a lot of those open shots for himself bc in a 1v1 hes basically always open. I do understand your point better now though.
It has so far
Yep, he's missed some games this season and we're still the 1 seed.
you're very brave. Respect
Been playing all season, minutes have gone up over the past month or two though. He’s been great! Suffocating defender, awesome hustle, great handle for his size and strength. Looks like he has scary potential but is still a little slow-footed and isn’t showing much athleticism, which you can expect. Been hitting threes, middies, off-dribble jumpers. Would love him to develop into a starter and I’m sure many Magic fans agree
Lol the Bucks are 1 game behind and yet you clearly think they're much worse than the Sixers, you don't even believe it yourself
No, you dont really take regular season games between contenders as indicative of anything. Unless there is some fatal flaw between the matchup or something.
I mean if we don’t shoot 1-17 from 3 in the first half we blow you guys out and this conversation never happens.
Bucks aren't on our level. Nets and Heat are our worst match ups.

Ben and Joel will make it extremely hard for Giannis to score.
Eh.. Yeah. You actually do.
yeah but you did so 🤷

If none of our guys ever went cold we would be 38-3
> yeah but you did 

And we still ended up winning anyways so whats your point? We had 31 points in one half. Even the cavs probably would've steamrolled us with that type of performance so an embiid less sixers team *almost* beating us isn't a shocking surprise. Terrible nights happen in the regular season, anyone could lose to anyone at any given night. But y'all are the ones who blew a 19 point lead at the end of the day not us 🤷🏿‍♂️
Still the 1 seed brother while missing Embiid or Simmons for 13 games.
Not a great game for national television. Yikes.
Gobert held 3 superstars to 0 points that’s my DPOY
Somehow Clarkson was probably the worst player on both teams tonight
Clarkson needs to get out of this slump, his own teammate is gonna steal that Sixth Man award.
Wtf is that clarkson statline
I'm just happy Bogey is 4/6 from three. Hopefully it'll help him with his mental state.
Great, we get to play utah 3 times in six day coming up. Fun.
This game was garbage time by the end of the 1st quarter.
I could have posted this at halftime
Who didn’t see this ass whooping coming?? This was pretty much a scheduled loss. Lol I used this game for me to scope what’s going on with our team as the clock on the deadline winds down. Alize Johnson was surprising
Alize Johnson! So happy for him. Hopefully this leads to him being signed for the the rest of the season.
I’m sad that I circled this game as an interesting one only to watch more and more Nets stars downgrade to out over the past week, ending with harden today
Alize Johnson played great. The rest of the team played like NBA 2K teammates.

Gobert didn't attempt a 3-point shot, when this was the perfect game for him to try it. And Ersan didn't play a lot. I feel I didn't get what I want today with the big 3 out.
Basketball was played today
Alize Johnson is a god
Clarkson. Yikes.
The Nets could have won this one if they scored more points than the Jazz
Miye Oni was not a smart player during his extended time tonight, really careless with the ball and sleeping on defense. 

I know he’s a bench guy but got a lot of burn tonight so might as well evaluate him.
The Nets had over an entire NBA salary cap sit out tonight.

Harden, Kyrie, and KD make a combined 110m+
$8bn per year to watch this peak basketball, what a baragain that new deal will be
Did Joe Harris get injured? Or they just pulled him out and never sub in again?
I know this joke is run to death, but in all seriousness this game was not as close as the score would suggest.

Looking forward to seeing the Nets at full strength again.
This stayed a blowout but seeing a team in the 70s and a team at 40 at one point was mind blowing.
This game was not as close as the score would lead you to believe.
One more day
Title should say the "Utah Jazz annihilate the 'Brooklyn Nets' by 118-88 with 27 points from Donovan Mitchell"
88 is a victory considering at one point our lineup was: 

Chiozza/Alize/Reggie Perry/Claxton/Jordan
The Brooklyn Nets* 10 day contract squad and DeAndre Jordan
Alize fuckin Johnson
Jordan Clankson
What the hell was Clarkson doing this game
Thank you jazz
To bad Theis couldn’t hit the game winner it would’ve been the perfect night
I didn't have the game on, checked at half and saw the Jazz up by a boat load. Turns out all 3 Nets stars were out. 

Are the Jazz still the real deal /s
More like Brooklyn Nots ha
All according to plan
As expected without our big 4 of KD, Kyrie, Harden and Blake
I don't always root for the Jazz but when I do its to blow out the Nets and ruin their hope.
We did it folks it only took the Jazz and no Harden Irving and Durant but they lost a fking game
I recorded the game and watched it late. It's 3 AM and I gotta wake up in a few hours, but God damnit I'm watching every jazz game because I'm scared we'll be bad next year.
All of the important Nets were at Kyrie’s birthday party tho. So this game doesn’t even count.
Yeah. But are they really the Brooklyn Nets without their three all stars? Completely different team.
They were showing Woj every chance they got, repeating the same trade-bait, hoping a Woj bomb would drop.
We’ve had nationally televised games on the second night of our last 3 b2bs. Not sure who’s in charge of scheduling but they might not be the biggest Nets fans. Lol
What? Alize Johnson had 23 points
The disrespect to Blake smh
Man's deterance is so great now he prevents people from playing
I want to disagree, but it's undeniable.
he came out and did his thing
Shooters shoot
Mamba mentality
Joe? Niang?
Mamba Mentality
That statline Is required so his 3pt streak can live.
If Bogey gets back to having consistent 20 point nights we can dominate the NBA
You’ll prob take 2 of 3. I will never underestimate the grizz
Hey when Ja falls down do you guys say MY JA JUST HIT THE FLOOR and then laugh uproariously each time assuming he’s fine? I sure would.
This game was garbage time by the ~~end~~ middle of the 1st quarter.
The Nets said the game was over when they pulled Joe Harris out after 5 minutes.
Big if true.
Steal right now for a willing team. I can think of a lot who could use his rebounding for the rest of the season.
Wonder if he has Superstar potential after tonight like Maxey after that one game.
I've said from the beginning that Harden and Kyrie were just holding him back.

j/k never heard the name before, but good for him
Bogey borrowed his talent for tonight
They're probably trying to rest him. I think he's the only net to play all games this season. No point in playing him if they're gonna lose anyway.
friends today enemies tomorrow
Inhilate.
Wait, Nash played 4 bigs at one time? Wtf
What are friends for?
Very cool!
Harris in shambles.
imma be honest I'm pretty sure Nets fans still have hope.
You realize KD, Kyrie and Harden didn’t play right? Lmao
i dont think anyone is counting this as a real game, except for the official tally, which counts it as a jazz win. and thats all that really matters for tonight
About as compelling as the action on the court lol.
I know y'all will be a draw come playoffs, but tonight was not exactly a marquee matchup. Lmao. Oh well, good to see the bench get some run I suppose.
He’s that one beyblade that saps everyone else’s energy since he goes right instead of left. And cannot physically go left. That was the vibe I got from him in the G-League.
Who is this. Seriously.
Did Blake get any points? No? Looks like Gobert disrespected him first!
Did you think I’d include those bums KD and Kyrie? Of course I’m talking about Deondre Jordan and Blake Griffin.
not a superstar, or even a star anymore
Did you miss March 2020?
Deterance so great he prevented the entire league from playing last year lol
insert dion waiters quote
Joe for sure
Shooters shoot (a lot)
Even if clarkson does this?
Jazz Grizzlies games are always infuriating slug fests. Can't wait
I was at the forum on Mountain Mike’s return to Memphis. Ja put on a show that night.

I’ve been watching Jazz games a lot since the trade, and everytime I see a guard drive into the rim just to get blasted by Gobert, I get so scared for Ja. Rudy gon’ get him.

Not really relevant to the thread, just wanted to share haha
Honest question as a casual jazz fan who is mostly waiting for playoffs, would these or any upcoming games be worth watching?  Any recommendations?  Total newbie here, sorry for my ignorance.
I genuinely don't understand why he hasn't been signed by any team yet. He's been decent since college and his offense has gotten better, he's consistently been one of the best G-League players but nobody's taking him
Maybe we could trade him for another Harden.
anal-elite
Joe played so I swapped him with Blake
well they are just waiting for one of the big 3 to check in
yeah i do.
I often get sucked into the reactionary takes but tbh I think a lot of regular-season games don't really tell you that much.
For real. I mean even if KD was healthy he usually sits B2B’s. Kyrie does too. Last time I checked having stars on TV is good for ratings. Doesn’t seem very smart to televise those. Oh well wygd
ah the old reverse Shabazz Muhammad
Oh fuck you're right, I'm so sorry about that
what you talking bout, Gobert literally swallowed Kyrie at the start of the match.
Give blake 37 min i guarantee easy 50pts/40ast/40reb per game
Then they would both be doing it. More than one player per position can makes shots m8
Wouldn't be surprised to see a 87-83 win in one of those games.
Don't miss Jazz vs Nuggets. It's always a close game and their playoff matchup in the bubble was exciting.
Honestly, any game on any given night can be incredible, or super boring.

You never really know.  

I will echo the other guy who replied, and say Jazz vs Nuggets is usually always great.
Banned in utah
I'm sure nobody will remember this game when those big 3 are tearing through the playoffs.
those some myplayer stats
And thats rolling outta bed too
4 wins.

2 vs the nets.

LOL
IF YOU DONT LIKE NEAR 300 POINT GAMES, YOU DONT LIKE WIZARDS AND NETS BASKETBALL
Half the wizards wins have come against the nets
The Nets

-  scored 146 points in regulation 

- shot 58% from the floor, 53% from 3, and 82% from the line

- got a great showing from KD, Kyrie, Joe Harris and Green

 AND THEY STILL LOST
I really can’t wait to see this Nets defense vs the Clippers on Tuesday
[westbrook fans comin into the thread](https://i.imgur.com/5J9kj72.gifv)
RUSS IS LITERALLY JORDAN WHEN HES PLAYING KD
offense > offense
WESTBROOK HEARD THERE WAS AN OKC REUNION WITHOUT HIM AND SAID HE AINT HAVIN THAT SHIT
WTF
Well now we know the Nets defence is worse than a parked car
Neither of these teams played any defense huh
[deleted]
Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
Harris has one of the best games of the year and then just throws the game away. Incredibly frustrating.
#GAME OF THE YEAR DESPITE LACK OF D
WESTBROOOOOOOOOOOOOOK
Brodie can talk all the shit. He earned it tonight.
Glad to see that shit live
Nets just got Bulls'ed
Extremely late but whatever, keeps the streak alive...snatching defeat from the jaws of victory here

[Remember when the Nets were up by 18 points and had the lead at halftime](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kuryt6/z/gitnw0z)
CLUTCHBROOK
I just decided to watch this game on a whim! So glad that I did! Love a good Westbrook game!
2 epic collapses in 2 nights
Holy fucking shit that sequence with Beal and Westbrook hitting threes to take the lead was absolute prime time basketball
Remember the Westbrook shouldn't even have minutes amymore takes? Lmfao
**RUSSELL BESTBROOK**
Westbrook is back, baby!
The fuck is that total score
48 in the 4th quarter what the shit
Classic Westbrick. Free Beal too. Wait.... they won?

But seriously, if Russ can play like this more and the Wizards drain the swamp on their horrible franchise by firing Brooks this Wizards team has lots of potential
Lmao wowwwww
Westbrook said fuck you guys
everyone who doubted russ can suck my dick

^sidenote ^how ^does ^one ^perform ^autofellatio
Joe Harris with 30 points, 8-13 from the 3 and 1 bad inbound pass that led to Westbrook 3.

Pain.
From WestBrick to WestClutch in 20sec
Bulls fans 🤝 Nets fans
That was amazing I’m sad it’s over
A lot of amazing things happened in that game, but can we please get Monty McCutchen fired?  

His officials are ruining game after game after game, and nearly did so in this one.  First, they march Durant to the line six times in a row, for no reason at all.  Then, far worse, they ignored the blatant travel by Irving on the inbound play with 2.9 left -- and then pretended to care about precision by putting Beal on the line with .7 left.

Irving doesn't have the angle to make that pass under the basket, unless he first takes three illegal steps to his left.  You cannot do that on your own end-line, ever.

If you are going to completely ignore some rules, you can't turn around one second later and pretend to care about seven-tenths of a second.

How is anyone involved with NBA officiating maintaining their employment?
Nets were at 96.9% win probability with 12.3sec to go!
Beal and Russ duo so fun to watch, when healthy they are so good
Between Dame and this game ... 2 insane finishes last two nights
JUST A CASUAL 295 POINT GAME IN REGULATION
Literally take the Nets, melt them down, use them to pave deteriorating streets in Brooklyn
THAT’S A LOT OF DAMAGE
I think its safe to say neither team enjoys playing defense.
2-0 vs the nets. Y’all sleepin but we about to win the chip!
Very excited for Game 7 of the ECF where Philadelphia beats the Nets 251-249 on the back of an incredible 200 point game from Joel Embiid.

For real it's astounding how many points these guys are giving up. I hope they don't burn out Kyrie, Durant, and Harden by having them play so many minutes in all these games.
What an epic collapse by the Nets. They just gave up 147 points to the worst team in the NBA
WESTBROOK HEARD YALL TALKING SHIT
LMFAO

this is a small nitpick of kd's game.. 

but he doesn't really do a lot to get open when he's in the post and it wastes a lot of time.. 

and it's been an issues since his early seasons.. happened with Tony Allen in those memphis series, and vs dallas when wes matthews was on him. 

you see with like LeBron where he'll get to his spot and just plant

Wizards really got no good wing defenders lol, they had bertans on kd down the stretch, who btw moves really well tbh
Defense - DNP, Coach's Decision
NO MORE RUSS SLANDER FOR THE REST OF O MY LIFE #BEASTBROOK
I’m so happy for Russ. Not a massive fan of his by any means but he’s clearly been struggling this year and this was just a monster game from him.

Hope he can keep it going
WESTBROOK SAID FUCK r/nba
Is this what the WNBA looks like??

Cos there's no d in this game.
What in the actual fuck was this game?!

Felt like part all-star game and part redemption tour.
Wizards = Nets kryptonite
a rare mvp like Clutchbrook game
Wizards 2-0 against nets??? Also, was there any D played or nah lol
48 points in the 4th quarter by the Wizards
There shall be no Westbrook slander tonight.
Beal 22 in the 4th
Pump this straight into my veins.
the death of Russell Westbrook is greatly exaggerated
Stop disrespecting the greats with that washed shit
What a ridiculously nuts ending. That Westbrook three was HUGE, especially after the brick a possession or two before. Pleased for him and the Wizards.
kd chose the wrong team
get in here boys! the wizards beat the nets again!
So our German friend is making a real difference here. Good to see
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
How you shoot over 50% from 3 and score 146 in regulation and lose.  These nets are gonna get exposed in the playoffs
I know Brad and Russ are gonna get a lot of attention for this, and rightfully so, but let’s not forget how good Moe Wagner, Ish Smith, and Garrison Matthews played tonight too. They absolutely killed it.
149 points in regulation. That's not winning you a title.
The Nets have arguably the best offense, and worst defense in all basketball, atm.
Lol
MVP RUSS VIBES TONIGHT
Nets need some defense desperately.
Holy shit what an ending
No defense. Just points and vibes
Wizards in 4
Thanks Wiz bros very cool
Disgraceful coaching
I LOVE BASKETBALL
This was a textbook “all offence no defense” game
CAN THE WIZARDS ONLY FACE THE NETS FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON PLEASE
The Wizards are a contender when they play the Nets
I left the game thinking the Nets were going to easily win and came back to see Beal and Westbrook hit back to back 3s
Wizards fans complaining about Scott Brooks, at least you don’t have Nash
149-146 in a game that didnt go to 2OT's at least. DAMN
2 of our 4 wins against the nets LOL
They lost to Russel westbrook clutch 3

bruh
295 points and no overtime. Defense? I hardly know her!
Those back-to-back threes at the end made my heart sad
Kyrie was right when he said the Nets don't really have a head coach.

We can offer you one lightly used Scott Brooks, he has finals experience with Harden and KD!
Wizards over the Nets? UnBealievable
Nets not winning the East with that defense
Holy shit 149-146 in regulation
Imagine losing to the Wizards with a superteam
Lol the team full of cowards that can't win alone plays all time awful defense lolololololol.
i actually watched this entire game and let me tell you guys.. it was nothing more than a glorified scrimmage/all-star game

it was as if both teams agreed to play no defense before the game and instead just said 'whoever stat pads the best wins'

the entire game was played in transition with each team shooting the ball within the first 5 seconds of the shot clock, no joke

this wasn't a real competition and all the Nets were laughing with Beal at the FT line after Cabarrot blew the game winning layup

literally no one cared who won or lost the game, they were basically just exercising out there to stay in shape

one thing that i thought about during the game was.. why did the Nets get Harden?

having KD, Kyrie, and Harris take the vast majority of the shots is more than plenty on offense.. plus DeAndre gets his dunks and then you have Green, Shamet, and Cabarrot get the rest... just all of those pieces together are already 10 times overkill on offense

yes, the Nets 'lost' this 'game' because of a fluke sequence at the end based on laziness, but if Harden played, all that would've changed is that all those Nets players named above would've just got less shots each. but that doesn't mean the Nets would've scored any more points, in fact, they might've even scored less points if Harden had played

i'm not really too sure where i'm going with all this but i was just really fascinated by this all-star errrr regular season 'game' and just had to say a few things
#WHO NEEDS DEFENSE ANYWAY
Worstbrook, Bestbrook, Nets Defense Suspectbrook
That was a mf'ing barn burner
WOW. WHAT A GAME. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT, THEN YOU PROBABLY LIKE DEFENSE.
What the actual fuck was this game. The score and that ending
LMFAO BIGGEST STEAL EVER
westbrook must read this sub every second bro
Wizards with 48 points in the 4th quarter LOLWUT
The Wizards could legit take the Nets in the playoffs because Westbrook becomes Jordan anytime he plays KD
Westbrook played so well tonight, completely different animal when he's attacking the basket
WeStBr0ok iS wAsHeD uP
Bruh, every Nets game literally like a 2K game...
If the Nets offense is historically great, what is the Wizards offense?
They playing half the defense and trying to win with double the offense. 

**146 points and 58% shooting, STILL LOSE**
I'd hate to be a betting man lol. Wizards getting blown out for the last 2 weeks to beat Nets.
Pain.
best game of the season so far
#FREE DEFENSE
How to beat the Nets:

1. Get buckets

2. Don't not get buckets
finally a break falls their way. Wizards 10 game win streak incoming!
What is defence?
How do we convince Westbrook that he's playing against KD for the rest of the season? Man, this game was fun to watch.
The Wizards took 20 more shots than the Nets... that feels unusual
Moe Wagner is lookin good. With Him and Hachimura back the wiz should be a little better
I watched the whole game, half- ass rooting for the wizards and with :14 seconds left I thought it was over and walked out of the room. Just now saw the highlights, It's one of those games I really wish I had just been more patient and kept my ass on the couch.
What a wild end to the game. Basketball is such a welcome distraction these days.
TALK THAT SHIT RUSS
How could the Nets outrebound the Wizards but have 20 less shot attempts?
The last all-star game had 16 more points than this game. 157-155.
I know this is buried 600+ deep but this is future evidence:

This is the turning point in the Wizards' season. Playoffs here they come.
Westbrook legit hates KD.
[YALL DON"T DESERVE HIM](https://i.imgur.com/BVKxznY.png)
Did the whole league just collectively give up on defense?
Russ heard y’all talk shit about him
I don't give a shit what kind of offensive talent you have, you give up 149 points in 4 quarters to this wizards team you aren't winning a championship. no way no how.
bruh 149-146 without OT. There is no defending in NBA anymore,thats why you see average players score 30
If the nets want to win this year which imo shouldn't be their main concern when they have their monster trio until 2023, they will have to move Harris. I think the best move for them is when his restriction expires in March they should look to detroit and see if they can do Grant+Plumlee for Harris and Dinwiddie  this gives them a way better wing defender and a center than can play minutes off the bench and the contracts line up perfectly at 27 mil for both guys. I doubt detroit would do this since the nets don't have any draft picks to offer but realistically the pistons aren't making the playoffs anyway so this move would be aiding their draft position next year.
That play by the Wizards at the end was amazing, wow.

On a serious note, even though Harden was out Nets have no chance of a Title run if they're letting in 140+ per/game, they're gonna get stonewalled by any of Lakers/Clippers/Jazz/Nuggets/Celtics/76ers/Buck, I can't see them ever winning a series against any if not multiple of those teams.
LMAO FOOK BROOKLYN
"For years, executives within the league warned Westbrook might be one of those players -- reliant on athleticism, without a reliable jumper -- who falls off fast. What we have seen in Washington is either the beginning of that accelerated drop-off, or a blip of severe underperformance.”
Lmao
The nets play zero defense man i just don’t see them winning a title
Nets fans: "Whatever we didn't even have Harden 🙄"
Lol. Imagine losing to a bad team in the east.
I hate everything
Brooklyn is gonna be one exciting 2nd round exit
Russ trash all year until 2nite. Shoots like 60% from 3 tonight lmfao
We own the Nets!
The Nets gave up 46 points in the fourth quarter to the god damn Washington Wizards
Fell asleep halfway thru the first. Wow.
LOLOLOL FUCK THE NETS
Y'all said I was delusional.

Y'all said I'm a troll

Now I'm right and you're wrong

Russ is back

Sit down and stay humble
Upboats!!!
IS THIS THE FINAL PGT???
I did say whoever plays defense first will win the game. I guess there was a light contest on that last layup against TLC lmao
Haha.
That was a hell of a game
Basically an all star game
WIZARDS JUST WANTED TO COPY THE BLAZERS
Death.
Taxes. 
Westbrook beating KD.
craziest ending ive seen to a game since last night
What the fuck
Insane game
We might see a 200 point game soon...
Man what a fucking game!
defense? you talking about defense?
pain.
Put this on a shoe Brodie.
Westswish
Lawler's New Law: First to 140 wins.
What an absolutely tragic ending for Brooklyn
Lol at that Harris turnover at the end
What? They turned it around at the last second? Whoa. I thought it was over by then. Such an exciting game! Kudos to the Wizards.
I remember back in the day the 2 highest powered offensive teams went head to head and finished 152-149 in double OT with Seattle edging out the Suns. Today we have a very similar score in regulation at 149-146. Just wild scoring
WHAT
WILD!
That was an insane ending holy shit
295 pts in a no overtime game lmao
Kyrie with the inbound pass in the 2nd last play of the game- he moved his feet. Can you move your feet for that inbound pass?
This and yesterday's blazers game...WOW best sport in the world lol
That’s some high scoring game without OT
Incredible how we choked that game away.
nothing is real, but dada is real
EVERYONE GET IN HERE
FUCK THIS SHIT FUCKCKDNKGNVDLS;
Unless you live for defense that was one of the best games of the year.
Nets Wizards games going exactly as everyone expected
Hahahahah
How ya gonna score 146 in a real game and still lose man SMH
The ref tried to move out of the way for Irving to inbound where irving can't move his feet. Wtf
Nets need to trade for a  capable fucking center this lack of defense is embarrassing
Welp, here comes the Nets blowing the lead comment thread
AYYYY THE "no defense" game of the year award
My man Russell heard y'all talking shit r/nba
YOOO THIS GAME WAS A FUCKING ROLLERCOASTER
So.  You wanted to take the under.  Lmao.
The defense in that game was nonexistent, but holy crap what a game.
The Nets are going to play a lot of fun games this year
My heart rate
You can't stop Westbrook and Beal when the games matter least.

NOBODY puts up empty calories numbers like these 2
295 points without overtime.
As a Russ stan, nothing makes me more happy than a game like this after hundreds of posts and comments implying that Russ has no place in the league now. It's just a 2-game stretch yes but let us have this lol.
If only the nets had a closer
Congrats Wiz incredible last few seconds but what is this god-awful product the NBA is putting out recently? Can't see the score half the time, monotone commentators ffs its just irritating knowing the standards they used to be held to.
These jersey combination decisions are just head scratching
That last minute, no that last 10 seconds of game time was insane! Congrats to the Wiz on a hard earned win!
We love russell westbrook again
WE TAKE THOOOOOSE
LMFAO EVERYONE GET IN HERE!
Omg Brodie!!! That was WILD
Love u 3000 Russ 💙
37 points for Bradley “despite the win” Beal
The ending of this game was wild as fuck
Serious game mismanagement from Steve Nash there not calling a timeout on that inbound after Beal hit the 3. They had two left but instead they forced an inbound pass that led to the Westbrook three
Nets need some sort of big man, surprised they haven’t signed Dedmon.
Game of the year so far
Joey buckets didn't score 30 for us to lose except he made that terrible pass
Happy for Russ, it was miserable watching him this season, now he's got his explosivity back, it's not age related. I will enjoy those next few months/seasons until he's done
Nets needed to fix their defense weeks ago yet Sean Marks just sitting on his thumbs.
Holy fuck the nets really almost gave up 50 points in a quarter
WOW JUST WOW
The living embodiment of "they won because they scored more points than the other team." Too bad you also need defense to win lol.
Vietnam flashbacks from yesterday ngl.
Omg I am fucking dying, peak Nets. Insane offence but they still lose cause they can't defend hahaha
Kyrie requesting a trade ASAP lmao
I’ve never liked Joe Harris and this game right here has me on the verge of hating him good lord
Reminds me of that recent Portland game where Dame hit back-to-back threes.
Was this an a pre-season All star game that I missed?
did anyone else think they called the foul on Rui? I was so confused when Beal went to the line
Wizards won because Beal didn't score 40 points. Change my mind.
Damn man Nets are good for boosting teams’ confidence
What a fucking game lol
Wiz held the lead for all of 4 seconds. Paper hands!
I think the Nets lack firepower. Maybe they should trade for Westbrook.
I'm glad Washington fans get to experience this version of Russ
The hot takes in this sub are about to be miserable
You cannot expect to win while giving up 6pts in 3 of the last 10 seconds of a game.
I turned it on in the beginning of the 4th, hoping to see some greatness/drama and was not disappointed..

Russ was on a mission. If he could only fuel his fire like that everyday he wouldn't be a joke.
how do you miss an open layup as a professional NBA player
NO DEFENSE.TRIPLE THE OFFENSE
Nets gave up 48 pt 4 qtr. what??
He held the follow through....
NO BESTBROOK SLANDER TONIGHT 😤😤
Nets having defensive problems is an understatement.
So the NETS are wearing BLUE jerseys and the WIZARDS are wearing GREY jerseys. The Washington homecourt paint is RED, and the Nets have more red on them than the actual home team.

My brain was thrown for a loop!
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Goat
[“Welp...”](https://media1.tenor.com/images/954fb52131da088eb24af7a378f21dee/tenor.gif?itemid=14206296)

-Nets fans
The dankest timeline
Lost his athleticism? Westbrook took it personally.
I hope the people who were saying Wizards offense is mediocre at best can shut up now
They said Brodie was washed lmaooooo
So happy for Russ
Lol Nets games have the craziest scores because they have no defense.
 Clippers fan are gonna be excited after seeing that Nets defense on Wednesday (I live in Asia don't question me)
That should have been a won game by Nets
Confidence booster for the Wizards! Hoping that this will be the start of their playoffs run. Congrats!
Worst inbound pass I’ve ever seen Jesus Christ wtf was that shit
Nets are brutal 😂
#WESTBROOK BACK
Ok seriously though, amazing ending and all but.... what the fuck were these jerseys?

Wizards were wearing gray, and white, and the Nets were wearing red, blue, and white??? Is it opposite day?
Bro I turned the game off after westbrook missed that three, what the fuck happened?
The title of this thread should end "Behind Russell Westbrook's EfFiCiEnT 41-10-8 with 2 steals, a block, and the go-ahead 3 with 3 seconds left!"

PUT SOME RESPECK ON RUSSELL WESTBROOK's NAME! 

My man better be the fucking sidebar pic tomorrow.
That shows you the potential this team really has. I think they just dug themselves in too deep of a hole though with this shortened schedule
LETS SFUCKING GO. still the best of the big 3 in my heart
playing defense like it’s the all star game
Put sum respect on Russel Westbrook 😤
That's what you get when you try to best championship contenders, the Washington Wizards
What an insane game. I swear all of dc could’ve heard me and my dad jump off the couch when Russ hit that three I can’t believe it
That game was so fun to watch
That Beal smile at the FT line tho
But Nets were missing Harden. They have to score 155 to beat the Wiz. 

This team suppose to make it to the ecf? Smfh
Shoutout to my homie Garrison Matthews for a clutch steal.
Bruh Kryie travel on the inbound and they just let it slide, ball don't lie!
The wizards are the nets kryptonite. We need a wizards-nets playoff series
https://gfycat.com/mindlessornatekawala
Blow it up. KD can't win with these cats.
I KNEW IT YO, I had a fuckin thought last night that Russ was gonna go off and I wished for it and he did what a fuckin G hell yeah
Wow this game kept me in the edge of my seat, gg!
[Nets fans downvoted me just a few days ago when I criticized their defense lmfao. This team isn't making out of the East without much better defense](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/l8cgr9/post_game_thread_the_brooklyn_nets_138_defeat_the/glbuieb)
Wildest finish right there
Can’t imagine having WASHINGTON ML. Stunner
WAS probably just wants to play the Nets for the rest of the season lol.
BESTBROOK CAME TO FUCKING PLAY TONIGHT BOIS
You fucking kidding me?!?! 

What an ending
INCOMING UPSET
Please can the Nets not trade for a centre, I want a whole season of games where both teams scoring 120 being low scoring for a Nets game
watching this team is not healthy
GME stock is more predictable than this Nets team.
This game was a fucking banger.
I just screamed at 2.30 in the morning when Russ scored that 3 let's gooo, everything seemed to be going his way tonight
Game of the fucking YEAR!
Looking at the score you would think this game went quadruple OTs
Just as we all predicted.
Is it possible for Bryant to come back this year?
No Jim if we learn to play a modicum of defense we will be fine
GG Wizards, that was honestly one of the most incredible plays I have ever seen in the clutch
When two teams can't defend a parked car you get this lol.
Hot take: defense matters.
Some stuff happened and then Russ regained MVP form.
man that was the most fun game I can remember as a neutral fan
Beal really just half assed his way to 37 points and the win. Impressive
“I mean, it’s transparent. It’s out there. It’s glaring, in terms of the pieces that we need in order to be at that next level.”
Wizards is 2-0 against the Nets this season
Them boys letting people get highlight clips vs them nightly and people think the nets will win the championship this year with this roster.
Damn, nearly 300 points between 2 teams. We're reaching 1980s Denver Nuggets level of pace LEAGUEWIDE. I think the top scoring team is averaging like 120 ppg.
They should trade Kyrie for some defenders lmao. Durant and Harden can take care of the offense.
If Russell Westbrook isnt the sidebar tomorrow...
Yet another game to add to the long list of examples that prove the Nets worst in history defense will not lead them to the title aspirations that everyone is gifting them

149 points... to a team that is 3-12... just incredibly awful roster construction
[The nets d tonight](https://imgur.com/2iPC7ad.jpg)
Happy Russell Westbrook Day
Nets really need help from their 3rd all-star /s
48 in a quarter nah we don't need to play defense lol
Wtf is that score?! Lol
Oh man, close to 150 points without OT.
295 total points scored in regulation. Lolo. What’s defence?
I know that TLC missed the layup at the last ATO but the original play was a KD iso. I don't know why KD didn't just move a little to get the ball.
The Nets have the worst defense I've ever seen. I know its early and Nash doesn't have much defensive talent to work with but you have to look at a coach when a team is performing this bad on one end of the floor.
DJ plays 18 minutes when he's a +14 in those minutes...GG Nash.
Lmfao
Bruh moment
What is defense
What the fuck, do the Nets even okay defense? 149 points...holy shit.
Westbrook heard the slander
These two teams are replicas of each other great offense no defense
was this an all star game? what is up with that box score haha
Wtf that an All-Star game scoreline.
Bad matchup for Nets. A similar team that is all offense and no defense.
Judging by the score I though this game went into overtime, damn I guess this is what happens when you have 2 all offense no defense teams face each other.
just saw the score. thought it was nba jam
What even is defense
Why isn’t harden listen in the box score
Wow, Nets really have all offense, no defense.
I fucking love looking at the box score every Nets game...it's always absurd
they stink
No harden and the nets instantly lose to the worst team in the east lol.
Goddamn the Nets defense is historic trash.
About 150 each with no OT, what's defense anyways
Who the fuck is Davis Bertans and who let him shoot 13 threes?
Fade em
What is defense?
Lol at the super team
When you shoot 56% and still lose. 

Pain
Hear Beal say they couldn't guard a parked car the other day.. Turns out they're not the only ones.
It took decades but I think the modern NBA finally caught up to what Paul Westhead's Denver Nuggets teams were trying to do scoring.
That was such a bad inbound by Harris, he had a great game but that's so disappointing
haha how does this happen in 4 quarters??
What are the odds we get to see a 200 point close contested game this season?
300 POINTS??? THAT WASNT OVERTIME???
Excuse me, Jeff Green 23 points? What the actual fuck was this game
So what you’re saying is, they scored lots of points, but also gave up lots of points?
I love how this post game thread doesn't mention the highest scorer in the title.
The Nets have perhaps the best offense in the league, and perhaps the worst defense in the league at the same time. Look at how many points they routinely give up. No championship ring if they don't fix this.
No defence just vibes.
Nets had players go for 37, 30, 26, 23, and none of them was Harden lol

I think once KD/Harden try on the defensive end in the playoffs, gonna be a spooky team.
I'm not sure how many more times I have to reiterate it. James Harden is the best player on this team. The Nets need him more than he needs the Nets.
How soon until rumblings of nash getting fired
Honestly, it's such a slap in the face that the Rockets traded Allen for Milwaukee's 2022 FRP, which at absolute best will be the 20th pick in the draft. Allen could have anchored a perfectly respectable defense for the Nets, his value to them was a lot more than just a late first, and quite frankly he would've been a solid player for Houston! Like it's so fair to demand him in a trade for Harden, but at least value him properly! Get something more than a token pick from the Cavs, sheesh
It’s in the best interest for the rest of the eastern conference to push Washington to the playoffs and secure a first round matchup with the nets so they can sweep them and then proceed to get swept themselves in the second round.
Nets are really turning it over against the Wizards for some reason.
still amazed at this finish. Nets D was so bad but their talent is just so good they will be in any game they play
Westbrook defense was top notch wow. Also lost count on how many times he and Ish Smith burned kyrie on offense.
Nets are determined to have every game score look like a damn All-star game.

How the hell are they gonna win a series with THIS level of terrible offense? 

Sure they can score like crazy but if they give up this much points to even a decent playoff team, their role players will get going and you will have results like this ( No I am not talking about the Wizards ). Not to mention their star players dominating. 

Hell, Embiid might average 50 points against the Nets if they match up. And Ben Simmons might even score 30+ !
> Nets d was so bad

...and they still were an inbound pass to the opponent away from winning the game.
149 points in regulation what the fuck.
The Nets literally threw the game away. Why rush the inbound?
All gas no brakes.
I find this stat from ESPN the most fun of all:

Since the Harden trade, the Nets have a 122.6 offensive rating, which is the best in the league and would be the best all time. They also have a 119.9 defensive rating, which is the worst in the league and would be the worst of all time.
As a rockets fan, WHERE WAS THIS RUSS AGAINST THE LAKERS IN THE BUBBLE
It reminds me of the year my Ravens went 5-11.

We still swept the Squealers.
Mo Wagner making 7 out of 8 shots. I miss that boy on the Lakers
Guys how is bertans allowed in the league with that defensive ability. My fucking God worst defender ever
I don’t know what sport they just played, but I don’t think it was basketball
Let's get back on the playoffs track! 

And remember, fuck KD!
This was a fun All Star Game
Scott Brooks had them playing zone defense lmaoooo. This guy needs to get banished to the shadow realm
The Nets need some defensive wings bad. 

Philly will eat them alive with that defense.

KD mad AF right now. They straight up choked it away. But brad and westy grabbed the game by the balls at the end
#HOLD RUSS STONK 💎🤲🏾💎🤲🏾💎
I think I prefer basketball without defense. Save defense for the playoffs. Defense during regular season just leads to injuries. Not as much fun to watch really.
Westbrook skilled player but that is not normally, This very very insane....They need to check him hands and game.....Maybe he not cheating but maybe he using the game deficit ...and this cant seem on tv screen..He needs to check-up
Enjoy your meaningless win, Wizards.

Washington only cares more padding Beal/Westbrook's empty stats
Westbrook is Mr. Regular Season. He's tailor made when it matters least.
Narrative games >>> the other 95% of the regular season
Crazy ass stat
Scott brooks was probably the type of kid that right before the exam rehersed the toughest subject only to forget the easy stuff in the actual test
HALF THE DEFENCE DOUBLE THE OFFENCE
I LIKE WHEN BALL GO IN HOOP!!!
Holyfuck I thought it was a triple overtime game
holyyy shitt when you put it that way lmao
I thought people were memeing about the wizards having 140pt games on both sides, turned out that was just straight up facts.
We like this offense!
If Beal decided to leave, what three teams do you think are realistic options for him and why?
give us the 8th seed we'll take care of the Nets
Russ vs 28 teams: playing hurt

Russ vs KD: playing with HURT FEELINGS BITCH
Nets really took that "half the defense, double the offense" thing to a new level
They are legit terrible on D. If they are at least league average on defense then they are probably the title favorites, but even League average might be a struggle for this team
Don't forget they were at 96.9% win probability with 12.3sec to go!
I had to do a double take that this wasnt a double ot game with that score
great offense horrid defense
My hot take has always been that they should be looking to trade Kyrie when they can
The loss doesn't even matter.

Even if they won by getting the ball in and hitting two more free throws, it would have meant that they needed to score 148 points in regulation to just barely get by a 3-12 team. KD, Kyrie, Harris, and even Jeff Green all had great games, but they still would have needed to put up historic scoring numbers to beat a 3-12 team. 

The thing is that they don't even need to be good on defense. If they can score like this consistently, they can even be a bit below-average and still win. They need to do something to get to that slightly below-average level instead of the league-worst level they are right now.
They were missing Harden to be fair
This Nets team might be the worst best team I've ever seen. For the quality of players they have and some of the performances they've put up, they still seem to find the most meme-able ways of losing these games.
KD can't win with these cats
I just don't get how people are so sure they are a contender. I'm not sure they are a lock for the ECF
Not only that.. they outrebounded and out assisted wiz. And still lost. Weird game. 

May be the difference was 17 turnovers against Wiz's 7.
TO THE WIZARDS
Where was Harden?
This happens almost every Nets game. They shoot lights out and barely scrape by or lose.
Harris turned into TLC in the final three possessions
I blame the fact that Harden wasn't playing. The Nets would have put 170 on them.
They have no depth or competent big and was missing Harden, not surprising at all they lost.
Clips killed us and I thought we played pretty good defense
The big question for Lue is who guards whom. Depends on whether Batum is available I guess.
Clips are going to annihilate them if their defense is as bad as it was tonight.
One of the few teams with the perimeter defense to keep up. Ibaka was obtained to provide rim protection so we’ll see what happens
With how the world works thatll end 67-62 nets win.
I've been worried that by the time we play the Nets, they won't suck anymore. But now I think we still have time.
Gonna suck if one of the five take a rest day.
Oh me too. That would be a great contest. But Nets seem to do good against good defensive teams.. Weird. 

But if i had money i would put it on Clips. 

Wait! what if this is the reason i don't have money.
Went from Bestbrook to Westrbrick to Bestbrook again in a blink of an eye.

I am a Mo Wagner fan with the same reaction
BREHS.. WESTBROOK JUST GAVE US FAP MATERIAL FOR WEEKS!!
Let them feast. They've been eating shit left and right this season and deserve a reprieve tonight
We in here

Lol, I love this gif

It's been so long, worth the wait though. Vintage Russ game tonight.
[For everybody acting like they weren't talking shit 1 game ago](https://i.imgur.com/BVKxznY.png)
That's actually us and DeepFuckingValue
Can't win against these cats
Russ came to fucking play
Give me a playoff series of this please. Rig it if you have to silvy
WESTBROOK HEARD Y’ALL TALKING MAD SHIT
Never forget that Russ signed his extension on KD’s birthday, thus making 29th of September Russell Westbrook Day
Two many time all stars out there and Joe Harris and Jeff Green combining for over 50 and they still can't beat the worst in the league.
Russ bout to get a call from the parking lot
Offense just got lucky this game, any another time offense < offense
That or this was an audition
Craziest game of the year
Isn't that their NFL team?
They can’t guard a two year old on a Little Tykes hoop.
The best defense is more offense.
Bruh, we just saw 295 points in regulation lmao. That's gotta be close to a record.
Russ tipping the ball from the inbound to KD on the final possession was pretty damn good
At a certain point the Wizards offense needs to be respected. At another point, the Wizards defense needs to get Brooks fired
O > D   
Probably the Wizards and Nets
defense just gets in the way of more offense
Yeah can't compete with these crazy cavs/wizard offenses
Who needs defense when you can score 150 points a game. This is what all offense bball looks like lmao
All about better offense nowadays
Wizards haven't been playing defense for a few years.
Wizards definitely played much better D.  Nets hit tough shots all game.
“Wow we scored, were up by 2!”

“Oh no now they scored, it’s like our score didn’t even matter, what should we do?”

“I know! Let’s score again!”

“Wow we scored, we’re up by 2!”
The rollercoaster ride was incredible.
[Amen!](https://i.imgur.com/BVKxznY.png)
Where’s the blown game link guy
That inbound pass that lead to the Russ 3 was so bad.
[deleted]
Nets trying to become the first 8th seed to win a chip
It's like we can't win games unless we own our own picks
give some credit to lockdown defender Garrison Matthews
he panicked, but also the cut from kd was weird
Durant is the one that took his eye off the ball. Waiting to inbound it any longer would have benefited Washington. Not Harris fault.
What a fuckin way to end that losing streak, and to the Nets lmao
It felt like I was watching an all star game.
Nah the one where the Cavs took them to 2OT and won was way better lol. Sexton went nuclear.
"It all starts with the D" -Dwite Howard
Hey now, Ish brought the D tonight.
they had a 158-159 loss to houston last season too lmfao.  at least washington is consistent with not playing D.
I dunno. Westbrook showed a pretty big D tonight.
Well, you can spell Game of the Year without D so... *taps head
Nash and MDA speaking with the big 3: https://streamable.com/jbxb85

[Suck it haters!](https://i.imgur.com/BVKxznY.png)
That ending got me off the couch for a few seconds
Westbrook and Beal invoked the spirit of Damian Lillard
Same, I tuned in almost begrudgingly, it's been tough watching Russ struggle so much this season but I figured it's against KD and the nets let's at least give it a half

And DAMN what a show, you just never wanna miss a Russ game when he's on like that. MVP Russ out there tonight
Same lol. I tuned in for the last 6-7 minutes and boy was that a ride. I scared my dog while getting hyped at the end.

The Wizards special when taking on a contending team
5 of our first 6 losses came down to the wire and poor coaching rotations and decisions smh. Brooks been needed to go
I think you'll find there's a strong correlation between Westbrook playing like this and getting to play against the Nets defense
[Suck it haters!](https://i.imgur.com/BVKxznY.png)
Russel westbrick is still and always been dirt. He only did that cuase the nets defense is trash. He still ass
Agreed, the calls were especially bad this game. And let's not forget that bullshit double technical for no reason lol
Nets every night: https://streamable.com/jbxb85
I mean the wizards have been legit on offense in recent years their defense has just been atrocious
Wizards have amazing offense just the same problem as the nets.
Can anyone let me know if the Nets are a lock to win the ECF?
FTFY: 149
[Suck it haters!](https://i.imgur.com/BVKxznY.png)
For real he isn't aggressive or decisive enough in the post
Nice insight. I never thought about this but it's painfully obvious to see once you're actually looking out for it.
Yeah if our roster didn’t suck so bad in 2016, we might’ve actually had a shot at beating the Thunder, because Wes Matthews played the best defense I’ve ever seen somebody consistently play on KD, only reason any of those games were close
Bertāns Is slow as hell
To the moon!
I wouldn’t be so sure about the WNBA there.
It’s what the Globetrotters vs Generals looks like, when both team wheel out the Generals for D, and have the Globetrotters on O.
Wizards and Cavs*
At long last, KD2DC, Pt. 2
In history
Harden back soon 😂😂😂
KD better pray the Wizards don't get 8 seed, shit is gonna be scary
Well you guys have KD, Harden and Kyrie lol I’ll take that trade
What defense?
Trruuutth
lol i watched the entire thing as well and that totally sucks you didn't finish it out. i was so close to closing out my browser too when the Nets went up 5, one of the very rare times it paid off to stick it out
Just like the prior one between these 2 teams
for starters, Nets were -10 in turnovers and -4 in steals
this game would've outdone that one if the Nets hadn't started ice cold on offense
why would pistons do that?
And imagine if they faced the Cavs in the first round.
Hit 3/5 from deep in the loss to hawks the other night too.
Like I even like Russ and I can see why people talked shit about you. You’re telling people to stay humble while doing the exact opposite lol
Game's actually finished now, so probably.
U cant move ur feet on a inbound pass?
Too many coaches are getting cute with their timeouts because they think the lack of stoppage will help their team because offense can usually abuse the lack of set defense.
I tried searching for "Brooklyn Nets defense", got a "404 not found" error.
Or that we were watching the all star game
He didn't play, thigh contusion. Probably resting it, it's minor.
And can't blame the defense on him
No, no it's fine he only shot 12 threes to go with 1 two pt FG
Put some respeck on Jeff Green's name. He's a good player.
ESPN confirms this, more like best and worst defensive ratings in NBA history at the same time...

Since the Harden trade, the Nets have a 122.6 offensive rating, which is the best in the league and would be the best all time. They also have a 119.9 defensive rating, which is the worst in the league and would be the worst of all time.
Worst coach in the league. Hands down.
You gave up too early. Never give up too early on a Bestbrook night
so how should wins and losses be tallied and playoff seedings be decided if everyone agreed to play no defense like these 2 teams tonight?
lmao  the wizards know they are ass already shut your ass up. let them celebrate.
I'd like to see the playoff standings just based on narrative
Nerds worry about "strength of schedule" while ignoring the vastly more important "strength of narrative".
In that case it's more like no defense, triple the offense
The nets vs the lakers will be like the unstoppable sword vs the unbreakable shield
When both Pokemon use Shell Smash
Your supposed to care which team puts it there
I LIKE THE ~~STOCK~~ SHOT
lol you wiz fans got me dying these past couple weeks
Don't worry, the Cavs will do that for you in the 1st round as a 6th seed
*7th seed, nets gonna be second.
Y'all are prolly like a game out of a play in tbf
You have to fight this over with the CAVs.
Russ vs *28 Teams: CALL AN AMBULANCE

Russ vs Nets:...but not for me
“Oh so y’all not invite me to the sleepover but you’ll invite this Kyrie dude? Ok I see how it is”
MDA wasn't fucking around
When Harden plays, they get triple the offense.
https://streamable.com/jbxb85
That’s what happens when your book closet doesn’t have any books regarding defense
Really, it's "none of the defense, all of the offense" now...
I thought that was our thing
"Half the defense, double the offense" loses to "none of the defense, all of the offense". It's simple math really
Nah it’s actually no defense, triple the offense lol.
A dude who tore his achilles is their best defender lol
I'm surprised it's that low with that situation
Snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
Is that a hot take? Figured most neutral observers were done with him, AB style
 Kylie’s value is not that high because he is unstable and cost a fortune. If one thinks he is unstable normally, just think if he is traded without his consent
I don't think its a hot take, Harden and KD are more than enough on offense. Trading kyrie for a good center would be extremely beneficial
> league-worst level they are right now.

They are trending toward "all-time worst", never mind league-worst.
This line of thinking is a path to post-season tragedy imo
Bro, this line of thinking is gonna cause major disappointment in the post season
Nobody tryna hear that shit man
Ever since 1984 (which is how far b-ball ref took me) there have only been 3 teams that have won the championship without being top 10 D that year. The 95 rockets, 01 lakers and 18 warriors. Those teams all have things in common. They were repeat champions and they were either #1 or #2 ranked D the year before with very similar rosters to that previous year.

I'm not sure a below average defence will cut it ultimately
this loss is just a representation of how atrocious the defense has been all season. it's not just one or two games. this isn't gonna work for a contender UNLESS you're hoping everyone fucking gets injured or covid besides you in june. i hope they make some serious changes in the buyout market.
They are probably going to end up with the all-time single-season record for best offensive rating and worst defensive rating.
Trade kyrie for 2 guys who can play D
Scoring becomes much harder in the post season when you’re playing the same team up to seven times. Nets need to dramatically improve their D to have any chance at a deep run.
We have to be in the 10-15 range on defense to realistically be able to win a chip, even being 15th is perfectly okay with this offense.

But this stuff is bottom 5 defense which really isn't going to cut it.
Defense wins championships.
[deleted]
They shouldn't even be needing James fucking Harden to get past this season's Wizards.
Probably would have given up even more points lol
bruh its the 4-12 wizards
We're talking about the wizards here and even with harden, the problem is they allowed them to score 140+ on them further proving this is gonna be a legit concern going forward
I feel like he would have just had Harris's points
Not surprising that they lost to the 3-12 wiz? Bruh
What else could Harden have done for this game? Run up the team's score to 200? Wash just balled out and got lucky in the end. Just one of those games.
In anticipation of this matchup then: Valar Moghulis
Ideally this is the type game we need Batum and Bev.
They are 6-3 since the trade. And 2 of there losses have come from last miniute game winners. The other they didnt have KD.

You are wrong in you think they suck. They do not.
How have they sucked
yep that's Russ
Petition for Russ to play KD in every game of the season. He always seems to ball out against him. 

Now add Harden, his former teammate in OKC and Houston.

Washington may never lose again.
He just dodged at least a couple hours of r/NBA slander

If I was Scott Brooks, I would show Russ a clip of a fake KD quote before every game
Everyone says they are cool with KD leaving, but you know they're really not.  Westbrook definitely holds a grudge.
Russell, did their offense lose this game or did your offense win this one?
Double cavs overtime was awful too
Man thank fuck I watched that 4th quarter, what the fuuuuuck

Offense wins games, ~~defense~~ offense wins championships
The Trae Young special.
No mercy
In 2019, rockets vs wizards ended with a score of 159-158 in regulation. Harden had 59
Just 25 off.   
>The highest-scoring regular season game in regulation was between the Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets on November 2, 1990. In that game, Golden State defeated Denver 162–158.
The regulation record is 320 from a 162-158 Warriors Nuggets game in 1990 

More recently there was a  159-158 Rockets Wizards game last season
Who is gonna be the first team with 200 haha
His defense the entire game was solid
It's as volatile as it gets
Nets don't want to see the Wizards in the ECF
First 8 seed to go 4-0 against the 1 seed then lose in 5
No clue how he's still on a two-way
Never mess with the Garrison Belt
He definitely panicked, still had like 3 seconds to in bound and had the ability to run the baseline.
We’ve beaten them twice now.
Just need to find a way for Harden to miss every game against the Wiz and also playing the rest of the season against the Nets and we are coming out the East!
this is like the Chiefs Rams game from a while back except instead of, like, the Chiefs it's the lions or something lol

Bulls collapse vs Portland
suck mah dick
"Too small, too small" God I irrationally love Russ
Yes.

Don't @ me tho
Could that have something to do with the injury he just recovered from? I remember him to be a much more aggressive finisher at the rim. Maybe he's just playing it safe and light, it's not like he needs to play with aggression when he shoots the ball the way he does.
we already have scott brooks! what else could he want???
I usually do too, that's why it was such a bummer because I'm usually a stickler about watching it to the end, but yeah I definitely missed out on this one.
Oh right. Didn't think about that.
I said i doubt detroit does the trade at the end of the post but a good reason being it fills out their roster more while they rebuild for the future. With more people coming back from Acl injuries relatively the same they would have a high level point guard that the roster is missing and a guy who can stretch the floor with his three point shooting, Dinwiddie is also nearing his prime so they could get 4/5 good years out of him and Harris while being slightly older he has the benefit on the 3 point specialist playstyle that could allow him to last as long as guys like JJ, ray allen, kyle korver have done recently. The pistons currently have the problem where they severely lack shooting besides Grant and an inconsistent blake griffin and this trade would fix that some.
The east runs through Sexland, Ohio
Allow it man I'm going to be insufferable today
I've always thought that you can only move your feet if it is under your own basket after an opponent scored. If it's on the side, or underneath the opponent's basket, you can't move it.
Chris chiozza and norvel peele didn’t ply either but they’re listed
I literally burst out laughing when I saw that they were playing zone during that last Nets play
there will still be winners and losers.
Celebrate what? A meaningless win that'll cost them a ping pong ball in the draft lottery

this mf said book closet
Is a book closet a book shelf with a door?  I need answers
Eh, it's honestly Bruce Brown that's their best defender. Though KD has looked good so far, but who knows how things will go as wear and tear piles up.
A dude who tore his achilles is also 6th in MVP race according to BBref. 

We’re shit on defense, saying a dude who tore his achilles as a slant is nonsense.
Even ignoring the fact he’s a weird flake I think it’d be the right call to trade him just for on-court reasons. Yeah “there’s only one ball” is stupid and you can never have too much scoring, but between KD and Harden they’d still have too much scoring for every other team without him while also potentially plugging up some of the massive gaps in their game.
I wouldn't call Kyrie AB.  Kyrie is more deluded than a bad person.
And KD *wanted* to play with Kyrie, that’s backstabbing to a whole new level.

‘I wunt to play with my bestest friend in the whole wurld’

-James harden joins the team 8 games after you’re back from your injury 

‘Trade Kyrie, James is my bestest friend’
Wizards currently are one of the all time worst defenses ever.

Nets just didn’t account for Beastbrook getting healthy.
Fortunately for the Nets, the Kings are the league worst and all time worst last time I checked
Their defensive rating since the trade would be the worst single season mark ever
No team has won the NBA title by being a bottom 7 defensive team - which they currently are. The one anomaly was the 2001 Lakers who were in the bottom 9.
Or comedy, depending on your point of view.
I agree, but at the same time, with their core players all being skilled iso scorers, they're going to have the unique advantage during trade/buyout season of being able to target defensive specialists with no offense who would completely fuck over most other teams' offenses. Obviously might not go down that path, but just as a hypothetical example, bringing in a wing like Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (currently a FA) would irrevocably screw with most teams' offense to the extent that his solid ass defense wouldn't be worth it. On this Nets team, though, that could be a totally different story - with Harden, KD, and Kyrie, the lack of spacing a player like that would cause isn't really an issue because those guys all can create their own shot basically at will, regardless of spacing.
And during play off?

I think someone mentioned that the 01 Lakers were the best Defense during play off
Defense honestly wasn't that bad when Jarrett Allen was on the team.

Overall they ranked 11th I think before the trade, and that was with Jarrett Allen not getting as many minutes as he should have over the first few games.

Yeah it's a small sample, but it was the same thing 2 seasons ago and last season. There weren't really any other plus defenders on the roster, but Jarrett Allen was that good of an anchor.
So 80's Nuggets style
How is this cope lol. 

I'm literally saying that even if they won it still would have been a terrible sign that they needed to score nearly 150 points in order to barely beat a bad team.

I'm saying that the roster as of now is terribly constructed and isn't going to go anywhere if the defense doesn't drastically improve. This is dooming if anything, not cope.
But would have scored even more points 😎😎😎
Lol nonsense he would have created a ton of looks he’s averaging 12 assists
The way they are built currently, pretty much Harden, KD and Kyrie need to drop 30 for a chance to win. They don't play defense at all.

Lol wizards again eh? Are they going to be challenging the ~~80s~~ 90s nuggets for worst ever defense?

Edit: now I can't remember if it was the 80s, 90s or both
Forgot how ridiculous Run TMC was jesus
The Paul Westhead Nuggets were also involved in the highest-scoring NBA half both combined and from one team (174 combined at the half, 107 from the Suns) in a 173-143 regulation loss to the Suns
Rockets and Wizards played last year and the score was 159-158 in regulation.
dude i swear some players don't know that you can run the baseline hahaha, coaches should make sure their inbounder knows that
You suck my dick.
Box score oddity, but irrelevant nonetheless.

Nah man, they make the playoffs to get beat by the Pelicans as Zion gets crown the new King while Lonzo Hart and Igram also get their revenge. That's gonna be one of the most hyped arcs of the series.

Cs are likeable side characters with one or two episodes dedicated to them but lacks the plot armor to survive the playoffs.
It's like being a Bullets fan all over again... (I grew up in the DC area, and am old)
Can't wait to see this all over Instagram in 6 hours
Dude will always score more than Seattle as of the moment. No matter how inefficient he is.
That's why it's funny. Wow someone always needs the joke explained
Could you imagine if a team had an offensive genius such as MDA and a hof point god such as Nash, they would’ve made the finals every year.... right?
I forgot the word ‘book shelf’ existed lol
*"Shhh can't let em know about the book closets"* -white people
I’d call that a book cupboard. I’d say a book closet is like a one-room mini library.
Chill friend. I'm not talking shit on KD, if anything I'm praising him for playing better defense than everyone else.
Kevin shouldn't have to be the best defender
I don’t think you’re interpreting it how he means it.
He is complimenting Durant.
[deleted]
>Wizards currently are one of the all time worst defenses ever.

But they gained a little ground on the Nets tonight...
If there's one thing the Wizards and Westbrook learned in game 1, it was to take Kyrie to the paint and post up Westy on him.
Playing against the Nets will certainly help with looking healthy
Think Walton is the only *worse* coach than Brooks and that’s pretty hard to beat!
Brooks doesn’t even watch film...
And that's arguably the only case of a team flipping the championship switch on.
They swept every series in the Western conference and only lost the first game in the finals after OT in a game where Iverson scored 48. 

The 2001 Lakers were 15-1 in the second most dominant post season run in NBA history.
And those Lakers were the best offensive and defensive team in the 2001 playoffs
This works better in theory than reality lol, it’s very tough to have non threats on the floor. For example, you could say the same with GSW right - Steph Klay KD is enough offense that doesn’t matter who the other 2 are. But teams would sag so much off Draymond and Zaza/Looney and crowd the main guys that it really did fuck up their offense at times. Lots of possessions would end up with Draymond wide open at the top of the key and unwilling to shoot. Draymond is a genius at screening and passing, so he found ways to compensate - a dude like MKG can’t do that.
I think given that the season is close to half way soon and they need every game to get their reps in, this is not a great sign.
im going to be honest i misread ur comment
Damn true  🤯
Nets playoff games gonna be first to 200 points
I don’t think they would’ve scored more. If Harden played, Joe Harris and Jeff Green would not have scored as much
They scored 146 points, I really don't think even with Harden they'd score much more than that. Diminishing returns or some shit
Without one of their MVP caliber players? We just gonna ignore they were 8-2 in their last 10 before this
Having watched the movie, the main spotlights are the musical spots. The movie itself felt very forgettable to me.
I have a weird admiration for how quick and effective his meme game is lol
>dude you really have something for everything

*She* does, damn epic
[Go to 1:30m](https://youtu.be/W0fKl43QmIE)
Oru Adaar Love, that clip went viral a few years ago
I remember seeing the scene years ago (well, feels like years ago).... just cut it down and added the updoots and it’s been on the hard drive ever since lol
Where is everyone getting this deep Sim lore? How do you know these things lol
TIL
-u/TheOneTrueDoge.
The Alex English strategy.
80s Nuggets mostly had that crazy pace
thats pretty much been par for the course since wall got hurt
more like how one-sided Denver used to be before Mutombo
Wait what? The suns scored 107 points in a half ?
What is the rule anyway? You cant move if it's from an out of bounds call but ok after a made basket?

What about timeouts and fouls?
or you are Kyrie and slide twice after the ref hands you the ball
aight shawty drop them pants
It's good to be old cause no one can call you a nephew on r/nba
No.. i meant that he just had to copy 28 teams from the original response. It originally said 29 teams before the edit.
IMHO they lack a good inside presence. Maybe a dominant one like Shaq? Or even not as big but very athletic, perhaps, Amare?
Them suns got extremely unlucky with injuries.
[Secret Base wants to know your location](https://youtu.be/QpBPIk3oS6Q) You're right tho, imo they had all the pieces but either weren't clutch enough or just unlucky.
They definitely would have made it one year if not for the Spurs being scumbags
Walk-in book closet, or bust.
Damn now i want a book closet
Ya hence “we’re shit on defense”. However, him tearing his achilles isn’t relevant, he’s 6th in the MVP race; adding that on is extremely disingenuous.
the nets
2 for 2 against the Nets.
RUSS looking at KD like 👀
Funny enough I think the game against Wall helped spark him up.

He played well against Atlanta and now Brooklyn.
God damn I love John Wall ❤️
the literal definition of flipping the switch
Oh no, it's terrible. They have a second round ceiling as is. 

I honestly have little expectations for this year, I'm more looking at next year, hoping that they can do something in the offseason to balance the roster.

Unfortunately I think you need to trade Joe Harris.
Yeah you can only score so many points in a game. It's not like throwing Harden in is magically gonna score you more than 146 points.

146 points. Lord.
Basketball doesn’t work like that. There was a huge stretch where kd and kyrie sat and the wizards went on a run, harden in the game stops that
> The movie itself felt very forgettable to me.

That's a shame. Are there any Indian films, Bollywood or otherwise, you'd recommend should you have seen any? I've seen Paan Singh Tomar and Bahubali is on my watchlist.
you've described about half of bollywood man
SOoooooo evey bollywood movie
Nothing weird about it
Sim888 is a chick?
You can *only* move after a made basket.

Basically, if the ref hands ya the ball, ya gotta stay put. 

After made baskets, it's up to the player, and he can run up and down the baseline freely
yeah i think that's it, timeouts and fouls you also can't move.
Ayo fucking yo
Let me tell all the nephews what being a Bullets fan in the '90's was like: They used to print "tickets" on Giant Foods bags that you could cut out and bring to any 1 of like 15 games (all the unpopular opponents), and use for admission to the upper bowl. The ticket sales packages were all about the visitors--they would sell packs like, "10 games, including the Knicks and Lakers!". And as a 12yo, I got to see MJ play, from 2nd row seats, because nobody at my friend's dad's office wanted to use the tickets. That's now little people cared about the Bullets.
My bad
Yea but they’d still need an athletic wing/forward, some crazy dude that seems like he’s from the matrix
No-one mentioning slim Boris Diaw makes me sad
>IMHO they lack a good inside presence. Maybe a dominant one like Shaq? Or even not as big but very athletic, perhaps, Amare?

I think Jarret Allen would be a good fit. Hes got good instincts and hustles, would be a nice addition
The nets currently have Amare as a player coach.
Jarrett allen would be great with them 

hah!
No argument from me, he is great. But I don't think he should have to be the answer to so many defensive questions on a team. Hopefully they'll make some more moves.
You're getting offended by something that isn't even meant to be a slant. Stop being so sensitive.
Harris for Boucher, Wood, or Valancuinias would bring so much balance to the roster. This is a video game roster where the kid just jacks up 60 3's each game
Harris for TT what do you say
You got downvoted, but the proof is there in the +/-. Jeff Green played for much of the 3rd and is -19 despite a great shooting night. If a team gets a run of 10 straight points (with or without answer) more than once a game, it reduces morale of the opponents a LOT
There's a ton of Bollywood movies you should watch here's a shortlist of my fave movies - Lunchbox, Maqbool, Omkara, Haider, Satya, Gangs of Wasseypur... Get through those and I'm sure you'll find more that you'll enjoy! :)
I still think Bajirao is worth watching. It's quite a spectacle and beautifully shot, even if the main story is like I said forgettable. 

There are a few sub genres of bollywood from what I've seen so far. There are the Tamil based ones that has over the top, physics defying, ridiculous action scenes like you see on reddit most of the time. I think that includes Bahubali. I haven't watched any of those so I can't say much on that. The more serious and dramatic films are actually closer to Hollywood movies, with the major difference of length (it's usually 3 hours long) and of course the musical numbers.

I would recommend any movie with Shah Rukh Khan, his movies are very easy to get into and he's a very charismatic actor that usually gets the highest production budget. He's India's Brad Pitt if I had to make a comparison.
BRO.

Take a look at The Stoneman Murders. It's from 2009 and its an absolute banger imo.

Loved that Bollywood movie. It's based on real incident too.
3 idiots
Start with 3 idiots one of the greatest comedy dramas of all time filled with some of the greatest actors. Great story as well makes for a nice intro to Bollywood.

If you are looking for something similar to the ops meme I would recommend that actor and directors first movie (Ram Leela) they did together which is a lot better and crazy over the top just like this.
You should also watch Rang de Basanti. Great movie. One of my all time favourites
Wait, whaaaa?
Yeah boi, put some respek on that name
YOU TELL EM UNC!

GO OFF ON THESE YOUNG BLOODS

I bet y'all had to hike 20 miles UPHILL IN THE SNOW just to watch a game too
To be fair, I go to college in DC and I went to like 10 games last season for $10 a pop. Such is the eternal burden all Wizards fans share.
Sounds like being a Nets fan growing up. Knew a guy that worked for the team, it was basically like having season tickets. Saw the backend of Kidd/KMart and the Kidd/Carter/RJ years, playoff games against LeBron's Cavs and DWade/Shaq's Heat, and never paid a cent. Hell, i only paid $16, fees included, for seats six rows off the court for their last home game in NJ.
Add a Kobe stopper in Raja Bell and enjoy your 3-peat
I wouldn't call any of these 3 the defensive anchor the Nets need atm.
Thank you for the recommendations! I'll look into those
That Shakespeare trilogy is amazing. I second these recommendations.
Gangs of Wasseypur is a masterpiece. I have watched the whole almost 6 hours of it in one sitting multiple times. Omkara is a very good adaptation of Othello. Satya I have not seen in a while but I remember it to be pretty amazing. Sarkar is another good one. Amitabh and Abhishek I'm a movie where Abhishek is arguably better.
Thank you for this insight!
I'll take a look at it, thanks!
I don't see what the Nets have to do with Indian cinema /s 

(Thank you!)
Thank you for the recommendation!
Thanks!
Nah, just had to drive from Fairfax. But it took like 45 minutes to get to the Capitol Center—it was in Maryland!
And if you need to buy a bucket during crunch time, give the ball to this iso god who goes by the name of Joe
Haha imagine!



^^PAIN
Hell yes! :) 

Maqbool was probably the best movie to be ever made in Bollywood for me haha.
mama
Omkara is probably my favorite of those three, but I do need to rewatch Maqbool!
Guys I think that Durant and kyrie are important for the nets
Biggest W from tonight:

KP played great defense

Please get healthy king
Sorry about the win streak Nets fans..but what is grief, if not love persevering?
[deleted]
Great defense from the mavs this game
Good job on beating the rockets there
Gg mavs fans, Luka is so fucking good
Nice win. Dallas needs to take advantage of opportunities like this with KD and Kyrie out
Dodo was amazing 😊
Luka hasn’t had a triple double in at least a week right? Should’ve picked Mo Bamba
This is the Doe Doe we've been missing the whole year! His intensity was all over and infectious. Hopefully its been COVID thats been holding him back so far and he's turning the corner bc he was amazing this game
People trashing Porzingis in the media. Here you fucking go. This is Porzingis. Mostly injured, but when he is healthy, it's done.
There goes the streak. GG Mavs
I hope we can salvage this KP situation. He's a great player when he's playing well.
>Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 5th Season. 

Did the Mavs win? ✅ Back to .5️⃣0️⃣0️⃣

I'll take going 2-1 this week after a tough loss in Philly but a Luka Buzzer Beater & Blowout win against the Celtics & Nets. Schedule lightens up after this week 2️⃣-1️⃣☘️🗑️

Luka was just 1 board shy of a Lebron with 27/6/7/2 on rough shooting especially from the FT line. 🇸🇮👍🎗️

Welcome back KP! Dude pretty solid tonight getting some early touches and blocks and played much better defense. Finished with 18pts & 3 Blocks 🇱🇻🦄✋✋✋

Doe Doe looked great tonight with some big hustle plays and big shots finishing with an all-around 12/8/4/2 👍💦

JRich had 11pts with 2 3's 👌

Bench Analysis 💺⤵️

Brunson Burner led the bench in scoring tonight with 14pts/3Stls ♨️👍💺

Right behind Jalen was Timmy with 13pts 👍💺

Burke with a quick 2 3's in 9 minutes at the end there 💺👌👌

Overall a much needed win after the rough loss in Philly to get back to .500. Definitely lucked with Kyrie & KD out tonight and managed to take seize the opportunity. Hopefully we can climb over .500 this week. Got the Magic up next on Monday 🪄
No KD or Kyrie was obviously the biggest factor in play for how the game went. That being said, really impressed with how DFS played. Dude really had a well-rounded game, and it was nice to see that from him. Also really liked KP's game today.
It was nice seeing Andre Roberson back.
Porzingis and Luka were both really good on D
Yes, I know that both KD and Kyrie were out. But still, the fact that we held Brooklyn to 34 in the 2nd half, on the road, to secure our 7th win in nine games while snapping their win streak is a nice achievement imo.
Harden can only carry role players for so long
Thank you mavs, very cool!
KP heard ya’ll was talking shit about his defense
Steve Nash a real one for packing it up with 7 minutes left still. I don’t care if we were up 22, Mavs woulda found a way to drop it if Harden was doing his magic
Good win Great Defense! On to the next one! Let's go Mavs! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
I really dont want KP to get traded man. Dallas just needs another player who can score 20-22+ppg and we good.
Damn Luka was 1 rebound away from the lebron stat line
Great game from Finny-Smith. Per usual had an impact everywhere tonight.
Still first seed I’ll take it
I really liked his answer to the Larry bird question. Respect and humility it’s great.
why is espn comparing him to larry bird??
LETS GO, SIXERS STILL FIRST. Damn the Nets are for real this season, time to give this team some respect they are a threat (no sarcasm)
The west is brutal man. Mavs are .500 now too
Rachel really compared Luka to Larry Bird in that post game interview. Like... they play nothing alike. Fucking cringe man.
We had to sacrifice some mavs fans during halftime for this to happen rip them fallen soldiers
No KD/Kyrie and cold from 3. Not a big deal, on to the next one
The loss that kills your streak is always the toughest loss. Gg Dallas, on to San Antonio
Cleveland now the 3rd hottest team in the east
#THANKYOUMAVS
I was not expecting this outcome. GG Mavs!
robes looked nice tonight, glad to see him healthy.
needed this tbqh. my “stay the course mentality” is currently, staying the course.
Luka one rebound away from the LeBron statline 27/7/7
It’s hard to win when 2 of your 3 best players are out huh?
Kyries impact on the game is severely underrated. 

Not even just the scoring, but the amount of energy and hustle he brings to the team is sorely missed.
The hot takes after this will be phenomenal
Harden was too passive. Need him to be more aggressive in games like this. He was passing too much and turning it over. Sometimes you need to be 60 point 5 assist harden and not 25 points 12 assist harden
Doncic > Harden confirmed. No argument needed!
Still chasing that first seed
If KP just be consistent on shooting over opponents like Dirk, he will not need a post game.
Doncic with the near-Lebron

27/6/7
Born too late to explore the seas

Born too early to explore the stars

Born just in time to watch Luka Doncic play basketball
No Kyrie/KD

No party

Nets need to get better bench and role players need to hit their shots
Only James Harden would shoot horrendously, and somehow still score 29 

>

That man just knows how to get Free Throws.. Probably practices new techniques just to get free throws
Rough second half for the Nets. Couldn't get anything to fall.
do the mavs play when they feel like it?

roll over in philly, blow out brooklyn
How much help does LeBron need?
- BKN fans after Lakers signing Jones to a 10 day

How much help does Harden need?
Answer: About Kyrie and KD worth of help
Thank you Mavs. Sorry for locking the shit out of you guys last game
This is just a hunch but I think the outcome might've been different if they were on the floor. Might be way off base though.
You mean a team that has stars over quality depth lost when it didn’t have two of its stars? Color me shocked
>Guys I think that Durant and kyrie are important for the nets




Westbrook, Beal and the Wizards disagree
Dinwiddie.  This Nets team is the same as Mavs team was when was hit by covid 1 month ago and 5 of top8 players were out.
Shot well too, and only attempted 2 threes. What a surprisingly breezy game
You guys locked the fuck outta the paint. Without Kyrie we don't have a midrange iso threat, so it came down to perimeter defense and Tingus making Bruce Brown and Jeff Green look like isaiah thomas out there
Thank you Mavs for winning this game! You paid your bail and can leave the Ben Simmon's prison
His trade value has gone up a bazillion dollars based on reddit standards
Stay healthy burger king
He’s been looking good for the past week honestly. Was injured - took a while to get back in the swing of things - now looking legitimately good. 

I think people were overreacting but I do have to admit I don’t like the rest of the Mavs roster at all beyond KP/Luka
That was a legitimately great line
Thanks, Vision
You were really hoping we won today, not for the win but just so you could use this
this is why I tell my wife we HAVE to watch shit like that the first day, you'll come across spoilers/quotes anywhere lol
Damn bruh why you had to do it like this
That was such a beautiful line. WandaVision was already a certified banger, but that scene was great
Well, I was born yesterday.
Literally made me tear up when he said it
the most beautiful of comments
Predicting the West is just too hard. There are so many good teams. I think the top 3 will probably stay the same, but after that it might as well be a crap shoot.
Philly is known for their rudeness.
i wish i could say "i told you so"

but i think we're more shocked than everyone else tbh
Thanks bro. You guys are scary when healthy and fun to watch. Best of luck the rest of the way.
I know it's an away game, but he'd have won the Defensive Player of the Game belt for sure
[removed]
Did not expect to see this pasta in an NBA thread
Get him on the court and healthy. The bubble and poat ASB 2020 is not that long ago.
If he can have 1-2 healthy playoff runs during this contract it’s easily worth it. He’s a cheat code when playing his best
Sad about the loss, but I love your comments in these Mavs threads.
KP looked mean. The rumors of his demise are greatly exaggerated.
Man I've been busy, i forgot about them picking him up the other day. I just looked at his stat line, almost 20 minutes!...with some okay numbers
A win is a win man
making the adjustment and holding Harden to only 4 pts in the 2nd half is incredible, huge props to J rich and DFS who were working their ass off in all that off ball motion
For sure, we even cut into the lead with Harden out so not like you guys were just taking advantage of the non-Harden minutes. Most of it came with him on.
The Nets had less than 100 points, 19 turnovers, and shot 41% from the field. And, we had 12 steals and 8 blocks. That’s a great defensive game!
Mavs game-planned well in the second-half. They doubled Harden, and face-guarded Harris, letting TLC chuck as much as he wanted. Credit to Carlisle.

That being said I don't think that would work against a Nets team at full strength mainly because we were without three ball handlers today, and two mid-range specialists so doubling Harden was very, very effective. However, that doesn't take anything away from your interior D which was very impressive today. You guys got a lot of great, lengthy defenders who play the passing lanes really well.
We still look off to me but there's definitely something to be said for stacking up wins even when you're not playing your best
Y'all earned it
This is true. Harden can’t stop Luka and KP while also scoring 50. It’s just not gonna happen.

I mean they probably would have beat Kawhi and PG in game 7.
His defense has been atrocious though so it's not like the criticism was unwarranted. Good showing tonight though.
I... I probably will continue not to think well of his defense to be honest. Carlisle schemed the defense to hide Porzingis in the corner on Bruce Brown to protect him from being targeted in pick and rolls as much as possible. I'm not sure how well that would've worked if Kyrie and KD were playing. He had some nice blocks from the help side for sure though.
Last year or the year before against Bucks, Bud packed it up with like 9 minutes left. Their bench made it close forcing Giannis to come back at like 3 minutes who kept running the floor and destroyed like a 20+ point lead in no time.
Nash playing TLC after constant bricks was something
Harden was 1-6 until then in the second half and had 4 points and a ton of turnovers. He wouldn't have done anything
yes
Our coach has done it as well and he has played with Bird.
I wonder white
wh*te
Typical ESPN. The quality of sports reporting at that network has gone down the gutter since tons of good people left there or passed away over the last 20 years.
I didn't personally watch Larry play but here are a few plays that are comparable

 https://youtu.be/JOOtrI6r7_k

Also Rick Carlisle has compared him to Larry as well and he played with him so i don't think Rachel is reaching too much?
Haven’t seen Rachel’s comparison yet, but our coach has compared Luka to Bird as well last season iirc and he has played with Bird.
I wonder if she really wanted to see if he had watched actual Larry bird games. Get a hot take that luka hates old ppl.
Super cringe. They did it to Dirk too. The three play nothing alike.
She's honestly horrible. Wtf are you supposed to say to that? "Hell yeah, I'm better than that fucking scrub."
Luka’s great but he ain’t Bird. Yet. Probably never will be. Bird is an automatic top 10 all-time player.
We sacrificed the "Trade KP" bandwagon so sall good
Please beat SA for us
Kyrie's gravity bro
Doubt there will be many hot takes considering there were so many injuries.
Ehh don't think so, missing two stars, we already blew r/nba's load with those two early losses to the Cavs, plus the team has been really hot lately so hard to really criticize.
Wtf
U joking right?
Ok, let's expand on this. Bc this is a huge development (not sarcasm) but, I don't see people bring this up at all. Watch Dirk, gets the entry pass, one, two dribble rise above, shoot. Porzingis has this idea, but refuses to take the time to make those 2 crucial moves that dirk froze people on. However, its very promising.
I think the role players are fine as long as 2 of the big 3 are playing, the main issue is that outside of the big 3 none of the other players can create their own shot or run an offence
Nets bench and role players have been rolling for the last month. Just an bad shooting game vs a good opponent combined with missing two stars.
Ahh yes I forgot that the Nets plan to rest Kyrie and KD in the playoffs when games actually matter and just have Harden carry the bench
He shot 50% from 2 and 36% from deep, and only had 7 points from the line. What the fuck are you talking about.
Don't forget to add in those 6 turnovers
Embiid/ no kp
lmfao shut uuuuup.  These stratwmans are pathetic.
You lost to Cleveland tonight. Shut up
Nah, trade Kyrie for a big defensive presence like Kanter, only one ball anyway.
Big if true
I mean Nets depth isn't that bad. We were without three rotation players who also happen to be our only ball handlers/shot creators and Green looked off today after coming back from injury (he was passing out of open 3s which he normally would take). We basically had our third-stringers out there getting minutes.
Well, tbf it’s worked for the most part so far
Harden didn't play That game though
The one from halfcourt should count as 5!
I meam he is a good shooter
He was also looking to get involved as more as he could. Effort was way better tonight, the ASB is going to shake off any rust and the Mavs have the 3rd easiest strength of schedule. I can see them extending the current spree by a lot, while also playing through KP much more.
I liked his aggression going low. He really made an effort to dominate the paint offensively and punish the Warriors small lineup. Exactly what the Mavs need. Im cool with him going for fadeaways from the midrange over smaller defenders (he still rarely got the ball really low, he was more a highpost today). Dirk made a career out of that.
this is the first game i felt like we had paint control, Porzingis played his best game of the year tonight
Mavs got a ton of size and really length players. They really game-planned us well by practically face guarding Harris, doubling Harden, and letting TLC shoot all he wanted.
>don't have a midrange iso threat

Harden?
Luka’s been in Mikal-Jail AND the Benitentiary. Thank goodness he’s finally out
Lmao love the take about how Porzingis has looked good for the last week where he missed three games with a back injury.
Absolutely
His best line since the end of AoU
Amazes me how Marvel fans thinks the cheesiest shit is great.
I was actually planning on using it on the chance we lost to the Nets without KD and Kyrie..
I mean that’s not really a spoiler lol
They really bit off more than they could chew with that show. Idk how they’re gonna tie everything up in a satisfying way with only one 40 minute episode left in the series
Ha! My bad. A great line from an interesting story
They have to keep Vision around after this series after all of this character development,  Paul Bettany is just too damn good
I think the top 4 is pretty much going to be Jazz, Lakers, Clippers, Suns (not necessarily in that order). It's going to be a massive fight between Blazers, Nuggets, Warriors, Mavs, Spurs, and maybe even Grizzlies for the last 4 spots!
COVID too. The mavs without that 8 game stint sans 6 players(3 starters) is a big deal. Any team could be hit like this. Though, the league seems to be more accommodating with teams since.
When I checked the standings and saw the fuckin nuggets in 8th it hit me how ridiculous the western conference is.
He still won it. It’s awarded regardless of whether it’s home or away, as long as Mavs win.
In a Mavs post game thread? yeah you can
it's my favorite pasta and most of r/nba seem to watch soccer. Prolly due to pace of play and the international fanbase.
Appreciate it and yeah they're definitely more fun when we win
True true. Back of my mind does wonder how a game between a healthy Mavs team and a healthy Nets squad goes. We'd probably get murdered but hey, you never know when we defend like we did tonight.
A win is not a win, I'll explain later.
He was -27, only being outshined by TLC's -32 in 24 minutes wtf
Thats totally good observation. Mavs defense was communicating during switches to prevent KP from defending pnr. This was something we couldnt do it. We gotta give it up to them. And tonight KP actually defended pnrs. Yes he had few but he was doing the right thing, which he lacked this season.

Also Harden shouldv played more pnr. Lillard attacked KP on pnr, Harden is no less.
I'm pretty sure TLC was in there because he matched up better with the Mavs defensively. If we put Shamet in he's going to constantly get switched on to guys 6'7" or taller, and any of the Mavs players would just run him over. There really weren't many other options aside from possibly Jeff Green, but he may have been on a minutes restriction.
That’s true, maybe I’m just paranoid. Either way, wins a win.
Rent free
"Birds good but I'm just built different 💯 😤 💯 😤 "
Luka has the potential to be top10, although he would need to step up in the next 2 3 seasons.
dw I am a Mavs and I know Harden is better. Guy is prolly a troll
Yeah once we really keyed in on Harden it was GG, Joe harris was a nightmare for a bit tho
Tyler Johnson has actually been pretty solid as a back up PG, he also plays full court press defense which is a change of pace for the Nets team. Unfortunately he was out to injury, which was why Chris Chiozza was playing today, who can kinda run point, but is just too small to really be a factor.
I can tell you are not affected by my comment because you typed the 'LMFAO'. 

🤡
They lost to Cleveland? LMAO
Trade Kyrie for Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert
Yea tbh the big difference between these guys against the Suns and last night was that they couldn't hit their shots
Sound's familiar, was the same for Mavs after they lost guy after guy to Covid couple of weeks ago. The most frustrating stretch I've ever experienced as a Mavs fan.
Kyrie was there for most of those games.
It didn't tho. Kyrie is there. It only work one time and it's a collapse from the suns
I didn't know who shot it, was pissed, saw it was KP, and then was less pissed. Those are the ones that show up at the top of r/nba if they go in, but cost you a possession if they don't. I'll live with it.
People are mocking that shot as if he doesn't hit those all the time.
I’m interpreting this as Mavs easily win out
Has he been taking midranges? In Houston he almost never shot the midrange.
A win streak isn't beautiful because it lasts
i bet you only appreciate REAL art like shakespeare
Cheesy sure, but it was a heartfelt thing regardless. We’re very sorry for finding enjoyment in it I guess?
Did I say it was?
They're probably gonna tie in another (surprise) series at the end.
I mean it won't get resolved. It all leads up and ties to future movie(s)
Jesus the West play in games are gonna be so fucking intense. Grabbing the 6th seed is gonna be absolutely massive.
Could easily see one of the nuggets, Warriors, Blazers (if cj comes back idk what that timeline is) passing the suns maybe.
its a fantastic pasta and i dont even watch soccer
There's also a lot of crossover in how they played. From movement to shit like attack philosophy etc. 

That's why people like Steve Nash suggest playing soccer to get good at basketball.
Losing is not that fun. Especially in the mavs sub
I mean adding KD and Kyrie two guys who were like made to abuse Porzingis on defense would make it a lot harder to defend.

Not saying you guys cant defend like tonight, but we held the Lakers to 98 when they were missing AD and Dennis and I have absolutely zero illusions that we could ever do that again in the future if they're healthy. That's like crazy talk.
no one will be here later
His passing was off tonight. Way too many turnovers. Threw off everything.
Plus/minus fucking sucks ass for small sample sizes like one game.
Seems like it for Green, can't remember hearing his name in the 2nd half at all
There’s definitely an argument. It isn’t clear cut either way
He hit like 2 3’s and i thought for sure he was gonna go nuclear
We played poorly though. Idk if it was a winnable game but we could’ve kept it close if we played better.
He's made a logo shot or two this season already and it's not like he missed this one badly either. He didn't shoot another 3 after that one and dominated on the defensive end. Nothing about his performance was disappointing tonight imo.
It's a turnover if he misses but they go in with enough regularity that it's okay. Keeps the defense on their toes too if you gotta pick up a 7'3 dude at half court
That's an entirely fair assessment
"you're unbearably naive"
We only truly recognize how beautiful it was because it ends.
This is better than my original comment lol
lmao, imagine defending Marvel capeshit
basically
Jesus how many series can they make, I'm pretty sure there's gonna be new Marvel content coming out weekly for like the next year
It leads into the next dr strange movie so
The play in games gonna be more intense than the final lol
I'm won't be surprised if the 6-10 spots are very close by in terms of winning %! Mavs have an easier stretch to end the season and it's absolutely vital that we win as many games as possible early in the second half after the ASB!
Congratulations, you avoid having to play Memphis, New Orleans, or Oklahoma City in a play-in round

Your Reward:

LeBron
Whose the original about?
Best season my AAU team ever had was the year where the kid who went on to play college center mid played his only year of basketball. 

A visionary at the point. Ran the break like I’ve never seen
Especially when I'm the mod who has to nuke all those shitposts...
Our sub turns into a doomsday cult after every loss
Let' all just bask in the warm memory of the Mavs being up 50 on the Clippers at halftime.
People gotta stop parroting this. +/- in one game sucks for assessing how valuable a player is but it's informative about the much narrower question of who was on the court when leads swung in a particular game, which is what we're talking about.
Uhh we're discussing about this one single game bruh
It doesn’t suck on any sample size, it’s a simple stat. It only sucks if you want it to do something that it isn’t for.
Not being rude or anything, but what exactly are the arguments that Luka right now is better than Harden?
There’s really not lol
Isn’t that a tautology? “We would’ve done better if we played better.”
Yup, good game from KP (who I will always defend).
He shot 45% from 30-34 feet last season. 10/22
Exactly
lmao, imagine shitting on a beloved franchise that brings millions of people joy because... because what exactly? why are you so vitriolic toward something that has no effect on you? did vision fuck your wife?
You may not understand how a "/" works then
Sounds like a solid business decision.
Falcon and Winter Soldier comes out in 3 weeks.
I fully support this
>Jesus how many series can they make, I'm pretty sure there's gonna be new Marvel content coming out weekly for like the next year

Hahaha you fool. Thats exactly what's happening.

There will be some sort of release every week for the rest of the year. Most will he Disney+ series (Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Solider, Loki, what If) but also movies like Black Widow, Spiderman and the girl from street fighter
Considering the money pool Disney has, and all the profit and success the MCU brings in, while also acknowledging the vast cast of comic book heroes and villians to pull from, the answer is a lot of series.
I mean that's only cause Nets are gonna wipe anyone lol
Lol true. But it's much more palatable for both the players and fanbase to lose a series to LeBron, rather then getting eliminated from the playoffs by a lesser seed that has a hot game from 3 point land.

Like that Jazz-Nuggets game from a couple weeks ago that ended their streak. Imagine if you're the 7th seed with a significantly better record and you end up having to play the final play in game vs the 10th seed, and they go 10/11 from the 3 in the 1st half... I'd be absolutely livid as a fan haha.
Icardi
Oof.
> but it's informative about the much narrower question of who was on the court when leads swung in a particular game, which is what we're talking about.

That's generally not how people use it though.  There is an implication that a bad plus/minus means the player played bad, which isn't always necessarily true.  There's a lot of room for noise.

Like maybe that's the conclusions *you* are coming to, which is fine, but you can't deny that most people use it incorrectly.
I mean Luka does score more on less minutes a game. Although I think Harden is better rn, but Luka is obviously younger
He said kept it close though
yeah needs to touch some grass he's way too upset over some shit that dont matter
Would someone who hasn't seen it yet even know it was a quote?
Yea I think WandaVision is the most viewed thing on streaming services ever. But will viewer fatigue ever kick in. New marvel content every week for an entire year... That's pretty fucking nuts. Also all the TV content they're making is relevant to the franchise as a whole so if you're just a casual fan and don't want to watch like Falcon & The Winter Soldier you'll miss out on plot points.
Yea i just googled their schedule, for 2021 they have Falcon & Winter Soldier > Black Widow > Loki > Shang-Chi > What If...? > Ms. Marvel > Eternals > Hawkeye > then finally Spiderman 3 to finish out the year. That's a lot of Marvel content.
> That's generally not how people use it though.

But that's the context in which it's being used in this chain of comments which is why it's appropriate
He only does more because hardens usg rate is way down. You should compare Luka with last year harden or two years before. Harden is the king of doing the most with the least. It’s not a fair comparison because hardens usg rate is like 27 and Luka is leading the league in Usg around 40 somethingHarden is better than luka at everything but rebounding imo. I think luka has the potential to be better in the future but not right now
Yea Luka scores 3.6 more points in 2.5 less minutes, Luka also averages a rebound more, but 2 assists less. There is a gap between their shooting splits though, Harden is 48-40-87, while Luka is 47-35-77. I think Harden has the slight edge right now, but as you said Luka is young af, he's 21.

On a side note, this is weird to say, but I'm not sure how much Luka can get better, like he's already so good. His defense could improve and he can clean up his shooting splits, but stats wise how much better are his numbers gonna be when he's in his prime.
Also I was responding to someone saying we stood no chance without Kyrie and KD. People love to hate lol
No? that's exactly my point

I feel left out of the memes. If I watch it early, then I get to appreciate when it shows up at times like this.
Surely at some point, but while you’re paying for your kids to watch Moana a hundred times, might as well get your money’s worth.
>will viewer fatigue ever kick in

This thing has been going for 13 years, 20+ movies, few hundred hours of TV if you include the pre-Disney+ shows, and they e gained fans not shed them. Plus they’ve only scratched the surface of their 60+ years of source material. Nah they can keep it running for a while.
We did also just go like 18 months without any new MCU content, people are ready to go with this lol
Where did you see it was the most viewed thing ever? The stats I’ve seen suggested it was the most viewed thing in January but was only slightly ahead of, for example, [the Christmas Chronicles in December](https://variety.com/vip/wandavision-audience-bigger-than-netflixs-bridgerton-in-january-data-suggests-1234913691/), which is obviously great but not really best ever. Nielsen didn’t even have it ranked number 1 on its weekly reports until [episode 5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlymayberry/2021/02/11/disneys-wandavision-cast-into-top-viewing-spot-worldwide/).
Wow. Such a good time to be a marvel fan, getting absolutely spoiled with content.
People have said “idk how Luka is gonna get better” ever since his rookie season. He finds a way somehow lol
That's fair and I'm sure these shows and movies will be tonally different (hopefully) so there's some variety.
lol accurate, moana is my sister’s nap time movie, she knocks out within 5 minutes and my mom lets it play so she knows how long she slept
Ah you're right! I saw people post that WandaVision surpassed Bridgerton for the number one spot and believed it meant in total viewership. Although maybe people were talking about TV shows and excluding movie viewership.
Haha yea I know, but I meant purely number wise. His numbers are pretty similar to last year (just a tad lower) like will we ever see a 35-8-8 Luka. Although, him scoring that much means either the pace has gone way up, or he really doesn't have any help, which aren't particularly good things.
I’m really indifferent to the marvel movies, my avengers highlight was being invited to watch one and sneaking in a twelve pack to pop them open during explosions so I wouldn’t be too obvious. Seeing this show has at least piqued my interest to the following series they’ve got up their sleeve. It’s an interesting take, reminds me of how literature takes on the author being the real creator of the material and it’s truly in the hands of the reader that the material comes alive. If you’ve never read death of the author by Barthes, I don’t recommend it, it’s dry as fuck, but a brief Wikipedia synopsis will surely be interesting to browse to see how fiction evolves.
His “development” from here on out will be defense (he has gotten much better from last year), adding things onto his game (he added a lethal midrange and fadeaway shot this year), and making smarter decisions (better passes and shot selection). As well as hopefully improving his 3P%
Thanks! I'll definitely check it out.

I'm not a big comic book guy, but I am a big movie guy and have watched all their content and enjoyed it so I guess I'm a fan. To be honest though whenever I see this onslaught of Marvel content and see that they have like a 5 year plan with different phases all I can really think about is what kind of content would Disney have made if these Marvel movies didn't succeed as much as they did, what would they have pivoted into, because they sure as fuck would still dominate the market.
I just saw your fuckin username, I’m dying
Undefeated in 2021
Nets got some real issues defensively they gotta figure out
Remember the old days (2 weeks ago) when the Nets were 2-0 and nephews were comparing them to the 73-9 Warriors? Lmao
Wizards win with their 2 best players going 16-50.
Guess 7 11 is really 24 7 they don’t close
KD and Kyrie bricking two open shots to end the game wow
WIZARDS ARE NOW 2-0 WHEN THEY OUTSCORE THEIR OPPONENT
First time watching a Wizards game this season. Good lord y'all weren't lying, Brooks fucking hot garbage
Who's your favorite center in the league and why is it Thomas Bryant?
The best passers for the Wizards was Westbrook and the Brooklyn Nets.
Holy fuck the turnovers and offensive boards murdered us. Washington had 23 MORE offensive possessions
Wow Brooks wasn't kidding about them prayers lmfao. Great game from Bryant, he ain't missing this season.
I’m just here to overreact
The Wizards did their best to lose the game but failed
Rui looked nice I think he breaks out in the later half of this year or next
i can't believe westbrook held the follow through for the brick rather than run back to stop the TLC layup, 

also at some point you have to say fuck this play, they ran a hand off with russ and beal which would turned to a pnr, kd was guarding russ and kyrie on beal, now beal instead of kyrie on him had kd on him.. that's much worse
LETS GO BABY, 67-5 HERE WE COME

Also Russ if you take another late deep 3 like that again you will cause me to go into cardiac arrest
Oof that last possession. Definitely some karma for those LeBron comments by Kyrie
That shot was literally KD's bread and butter
I knew we could turn this around! Wizard Party!
Ngl thought it was over when kyrie got into his spot and went up for the 3
FINALLY I HAVE SOMEONE THAT CAN MAKE THAT SHOT.

#nah fam
Nets have lost 4 of their last 5 games.

Not concerned as of now as I kinda expected them to be rusty but the turnovers and rebounding are somewhat worrisome.
TBF, Kyrie was right - that motherfucker can make that shot *just as well as he can*.
I’m here for the overreactions
Nets get crowned too early?
i can't believe that Kyrie and KD missed clean game winners, CONSECUTIVELY!!
Knicks have a better record than the nets
What a funny game
The undefeated dream is still alive lets go Wiz
FULL STRENGTH WIZARRRDS
I only really was able to watch midway through the third till the end, but from what I saw it seemed like Rui was doing so well keeping up with KD which was impressive as fuck.
I taught Brooklyn going with Green at center lost them the game, Westbrook finally attacked the rim and could go one on one without fearing Allen who really had a good impact on defense
Despite Russ' best efforts, Washington still won
Durant is an emotional player. Durant plays hero ball. Durant doesn't elevate his teammates. Durant has a low ceiling. Durant can't win you a championship on his own.  Durant lost to the Wizards in 2021.  You can't count on Durant to score 90 a night.
https://i.imgur.com/69YlAIt.gifv
“One thing I’ve always been comfortable with is I felt like I was the best option on every team I’ve played for down the stretch. This is the first time in my career where I can look down and be like, ‘That motherf—– can make that shot too!” -Kyrie Irving, 2020
Totally normal and expected result.
Bk will be fine
Kinda ironic that Kyrie and his supposedly clutch new teammate KD both couldn't hit the clutch shot to finish out the game 👀
WE DID IT
Bricklin Nets. sorry
The full Westbrook experience.

Seriously though, the guy has shocking decision making
I like this Wizards team. Fun basketball whether it works or not.
Russ and Beal with 51 points on 16/50 and the WIN.
Westbrook with only 2 TOs the highlight for me. And the Nets choking, of course.
I thought Kyrie could finally trust a team mate to make a bucket?
Is this a part of the takeover of New York that I was told about?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Thomas Bryant MIP
Scott Brooks on the key to stopping Kevin Durant’s jump shooting: “Pray and hope he misses."

It worked out lol
20 turnovers and getting killed on rebounds. That’s a problem right now.
Kyrie : "This is the first time in my career I can look across the court and see another motherfucker who can make a game winning shot too"

Didn’t age well.
As soon as they waived Joe's 3 off I knew we were going to lose by less than 3 lmao.
imagine losing to us when beal and westbrook shot absolutely horrible. Nets aren't making the playoffs
Russ and Beal were absolutely chucking... And they still won. This really was a odd game.
KD kyrie choke haHAA
KD is so unclutch when isn't on a 73 win team its actually HILARIOUS
LeBron would've made that, Kyrie
I'm okay with the L. Best two players missed. Nothing I can do.
The Nets deserved to lose that game, the only reason it was close is it was the Wizards and WB was playing horribly. So many turnovers, so many second chance opportunities allowed. They lost by luck at the end, those were good shots and you take them everytime, but damn they did not play well.
Westbrook could be such a good player for us if he took half as many shots and committed to driving to the basket. He made some fantastic plays when he stuck to his strengths which were outweighed by the terrible shot selection at the end
Nets are pretenders
Can’t believe a glorified stat pad and some mf named raul beat the 2nd best team in the NBA
The Washington Wizards (2-5) defeat Russell Westbrook (7/25)
Nets got killed on the offensive glass and LeVert was brutal, dude was taking some awful shots
Nets have also lost to Memphis this year. Not great.
wtf was with every foul called this entire game being like four seconds late
Russ and KD battling it out again is the greatest timeline. You love to see it!
And just like that Wizards are 2-5

I saw a few Wiz fans thinking they could go 0-12 in the next few games since it’s a tough schedule
67-5 BABY
Nets not winning anything this year they can’t defend
Nets gave up offensive rebounds to the Wizards all game so it was only predictable they’d lose the lead and the game by giving one up. They can’t rebound. Also KD and Kyrie both missing wide open game winners got twitter laughing their ass off, sports writers might need to relax with that finals prediction Nets got a lot of weaknesses
Why are people shitting on russ when beal barely shot better than him. Russ also had 10 assists to only 2 turnovers.
Bryant is seriously one of the best offensive centers in the league. Westbrooks passing has been good but still the usual shot selection issues lol
I don't think either team actually won
I appreciate beals last second pass to Bryant but damn we need to let Rui go to work in the low post towards the end of these games. He’s a much more efficient player then Westbrook and should be getting like 5-6 of Westbrook’s jacked up shots
Russ showed up BIG in the fourth with creating, scoring and getting to the line he was gonna make up for his first 3 quarters amazing
What a statement! Our defense definitely stood up this time.
I'm also digging all the intangibles Westbrook is bringing with his leadership and decision making. He sacrifices taking difficult shots when we need, and its definitely a sign of confidence.
Well kyrie took the last shot then Durant took another last shot. 

Both were not heavily contested.

Cant really say much.

You had your best 2 options and they couldn't close it.
This has been a weird season and nothing makes sense in the standings
Looks like the Nets are trying to beat us at inconsistency.
Hachimura is a huge part of the wizards’ success.
Two MVPs and their all-nba scoring guard teammates going at it in a one point game decided at the buzzer is a special thing
First time watching a full game of the Wizards this season and I can not believe how horrid Westbrook mid-range game has evolved into even a WORST way than before. Taking so many forced and out of rythm shots was making me nuts.

And then Beal had a cold game... And Hachimura was really weak on defense... And still won! I guess Thomas Bryant is their alpha dog now! He played like a beast
Great game. Tough misses
Two closers, two bricks
I guess Brooks defensive plan was right lol
*Never forget*

“This is the first time in my career where I can be like, ‘that motherfucker can make that shot too”
Westbrook 7/25... I know they won but will he learn/change his playstlyle? No doubt he's a great player but should he be taking on a more passive/facilitator role like Ben Simmons?
Bestbrook > that snake ass bitch
Someone tell me how to feel about Westbrook!
Refs were horrific
Kyrie should have looked at the stats and known he wasn't clutch like that.
As long as he takes seven 3's he's trashbrook. 

Its frustrating as fuck seeing someone who could be great be a shit because their petty and full of it.
Lmao two players that can take the last shot 😂😂🤣
Definition of chokers
Westbrook can carry a team for 46 minutes or so, but he just seems so boneheaded in the clutch.

Was really great to see the Wizards put the ball in Beal's hands those last two possessions.
Who in the east can stop the Nets?
"FIRST TIME HAVING A TEAMMATE THAT HITS CLUTCH SHOTS" LOL
Brooklyn and Washington with a high scoring game was expected.
Anyone in this sub over 7 foot tall that would like to rebound for the nets?
I can't believe KD missed that wide open midrange
I’ll live with us taking those shots
Why the heck did durant lean so heavily in that shot? He was wide open. Geez
We got lucky there at the end but nice win, we needed it
That motherfucker can make that shot too. Both go on to miss go ahead jumpers lol
That's just poor coaching by Nash, freaking outrageous.
pain
Ooof. Thought KD's shot was going in for sure
Why did kyrie shoot a 3???
Yes
guess some were a bit too quick to claim were the nets as champs after the pre season
Westbrook nearly cost us the game with his poor shot selection but we actually managed some stops for once.
LeBron had like a flawless 12pt 4th quarter and Durant bricked clutch shot after clutch shot. Skip is gonna entertain me a lot tomorrow.
Do we have the best record in NYC?
this team is detrimental to my health
["This is the first time in my career where I can look down and be like, 'That motherf----r can make that shot, too," Irving said.](https://streamable.com/v08bhk)
"That mother f*cker can make the shot too "
when Bryant decided to make them clutch moves
Worrying that 2 of the Nets losses so far are to the Hornets and Wiz *with* Kyrie and KD?
50% from the field, 43% from 3, 90% from the free throw line. Kyrie and KD combine for 58, yet somehow we still lose.
Scott brooks was right. Pray KD misses.
Thomas Bryant was amazing those last few possessions
 i think the nets offense is already pretty good, even with Levert not really playing on a high level. . Nevermind the last to shots today. They really need to practice on defense though.
HAHAHAHAHAH
The referees gave us this game...
Westbrook was good in the 4th quarter until his last brick, why would he take that when Bertans is standing next to him ??
i thought KD for sure would sink that last shot. had an open look and everything.
Defense is a huge issue for this Nets team. Elite firepower alone can't make you contend.
Cut WB's shots in half and let Bertans shoot from half court instead, those are better shots 100%.
Westbrook and Beal go a combined 16 for 50 and the Wiz still win? 2021 about to be just as crazy as 2020.
Nets top-heavy as sh** defense stinks also
This team has some rebounding issues that need to be addressed
I died about 7 years ago and went to hell

The first round of punishment was for my team's GM to trade all of the picks we own for some has beens all for 1 mediocre season.

Next, my team became absolutely terrible and we still didn't have those picks, leaving me completely and utterly hopeless.

But that wasn't enough. They decided that the ultimate punishment was to give me all the hope in the world, let me just sit in anxiety for 18 months, and then completely crumble every bit of hope I ever had. Fuck. Fuck. Fuuuuuuuuuucccckkkkkk.
Cry haters
Was impressed by Rui, Ish and Bryant tonight. They went on and had some great moments. Bertans did good too.

Russ please stop shooting, my god!

Beal wtf start hitting more shots.

Very good game to watch, the Wiz improved a bit on defense and the Nets were good until they started to toss the ball away later in the game. Kyrie and KD choking in the end was weird though, they had great looks.
The NBA TV guy referencing "Where the money reside" after the missed gamewinners had me dead lmao.
1/7??? Westbrook gotta stop taking 3’s man....
Not the result I was anticipating, I'll be honest.
Russ with +0, 7-25 from the field, 1-7 from 3.   I would have expected a blowout.

Who the FUCK is D. Bertans the God with a +16?

I wish I didn't miss this game! Screw local blackouts.
Haven’t seen any Nets games, not trying to talk shit or anything. I genuinely want to know are Nets fans okay with Kyrie having more shots than KD? Do you guys think this is gonna be an issue with KD the more this happens?
Russ should not have taken that last 3. I'm glad they pulled this one out but he would've been massacred for that stupid shot if they lost this one.
Man if you told me the Nets would be 3-4 after those first couple of games.

They have all the power offensively but absolute sieves on defense.
Wow LeVert really hurt his team tonight a couple possessions late where you would want Kyrie taking the shot instead of a contested mid range LeVert jumper
Nets fans:

How is TLC?

Saw he got 20 minutes. Legit bench piece or just playing because the bench is shallow?
49 to 41 % shooting - and you lose...
How do you win a basketball game when your two best players score 51 points on 50 fucking attempts. Looks like the Nets really needed dinwiddie.
49.5/43.8/90.3  v.s  41.3/36.4/73.5

I wonder how often in NBA history a team loses while shooting higher percentages in all 3 categories.
KD playing 37 minutes??
Kyrie tomorrow: "LeBron is the most clutch player I've played with"
Why not just show the on/off +/-
67-5 let's go
A loss to the Hornets and Wizards?
Finally got a teammate that I can rely on to hit those clutch shots 🤪
25 shots for Westbrook? Only 15 shots for Durant? You can't have Westbrook taking 25 shots, nor can you have Durant only taking 15 shots.  This is how you lose games.
Nets lock to win the east
Then dinwiddie gets hurt and 
Oh no durant wishes he stayed with the warriors lol
Guess supersteams aren't that easy to make
No excuse the losing to wizards at home…think their problems are bigger Than expected. Maybe they will figure things out though
Russell Westbrook should have put more stats into his shooting and intelligence when he made his build. Would be the best player in the NBA
We were fucked the minute Dinwiddie went down

Either we make moves before the trade deadline or we're a 2nd round exit.
The nets are a good team but they rely way too much on KD and Kyrie’s individual talent to close out games..

Idc how good a player, shots are going to miss like today more often than they go in. This hero ball your turn - my turn way of playing will not win a ring
So I guess only one 6’10 scoring wing in the Atlantic Division can hit a game winner against a team with only 1 win.
The Nets are not serious LMAO.
Russell Westbrook won a basketball game!!!
Is Durant overrated? Is his legacy over? Can BKN make the playoffs? 

That was how Curry slander sounded.
Russ tried his hardest to throw this one away. Good win for the Wizards.
Thriller! Beal misses a lot of those semi open layups tho
I'm 100% off of the Westbrook train.

Can't believe the Wizards pulled through. Really fun game to watch though.
McClunky Worstbrick at it again
LMFAOOO how do you lose to the wizards? What an overrated team the nets are, worse part is they can’t even attempt to trade for harden with dinwiddie out for the season
despite westbrook's best efforts, the wizards won the game
Westbrook did his best to lose but it wasn't enough
Good game but Russ is honestly painful to watch
I'm truly not trying to be reactionary, and I'm certainly not a Westbrook hater, but man I just don't think he's a player that can be on a championship team.  Tonight he was 7-25, but looking beyond the stats and looking at his decision making it's just fucking awful.  In the fourth he took so many shots, many of them threes above the break where the defense was just daring him to shoot.  And of course he took the bait.  He had a post up against TLC where he essentially froze out the rest of the offense and threw up a wild, awful brick that didn't even touch the rim.  At this point is his career you would think he'd improve his offensive decision making but it just won't happen.  He is who he is, for better or worse.
Imagine how terrible you must be to lose games in 2021
I for one am excited for the Knicks/Wizards ECF.
We part of the same club my guy!
Incoming **67-5**
Not in Europe though.  The Bulls game ended in 2021 here
They're a mid season trade away from picking up a defensive wing imo
their starters are fine, the real issue is their bench. It's nonexistent
It's not even defense really. It's rebounding. They never secure the possession which is just as crucial as the initial defense. The wiz only shot 41% but had 23 more shots than the nets which is a shit ton of more shots
Both of these teams, I think they switch too much on defence.
This is why I don’t see them getting past the Bucks or Heat, and maybe even Philly and Boston. All matchup nightmares that can defend and (mostly) match the offense.
I’m sure defensive masterminds Nash and Dantoni can figure it out
The wizards don’t even have a good offense they just score a lot of points /s
I like watching defense too - but it's not there. I think Caris is overthinking stuff and seems to be just straight jacking stuff up sometimes. He chilled out a bit after Kyrie talked to him I think.
Our biggest weakness coming in to this season was defence. That was obvious. Yet we decided to trade for and sign like 4 small guards.. I don’t get it. The 2 that need to be traded before the deadline are DJ and Prince, but unfortunately they’re both friends of KD so I don’t think that’s going to happen.
Nash is showing huge inexperience. He has implement no defensive system at all and it’s evident from the poor defense.

He has implemented no offensive system. It’s literally just iso super star ball which is just AAU ball.
That first game thread was ridiculous
Basketball fans overreacting? I'm not sure that happens.
Kids here vastly underestimate the time it takes for a new team to gel.
Oh so we doing the counterjerk now
When will people realize that the reason the 73-9 Warriors were so special was because of how rare of a feat that was
I mean they do look good. Just bad luck missing those two shots lol. Also Dinwiddie tore his ACL so that's another blow
Dinwiddie isn’t a garbage player, he’s a key piece for them
This sub could be the encyclopedia entry for “recency bias”
That was dumb like its dumb saying they are bad now. What matters really is getting a Playoff spot for a team like the nets.
Could you please explain what "nephews" means? This is a serious question, and I appreciate your answer. Thank you!
Lmao forreal. But to be fair it wasn't just reddit. The media were feeding into it too
Dinwiddie's injury was a major blow. Just goes to show that nothing is guaranteed in this league, and that sometimes all it takes is a key injury.
lmao we actually looked good though.. I don’t know what the hell happened since then
[deleted]
Good lord
Wym that’s a great batting average
Nets defense in the paint was rec ball level. Wizards crushed them on boards, in the paint, and on turnovers... that's how.
what of it?
I’m keeping this
Give my man an award for this
idk if you came up with this but you're gonna be hearing it a lot more often
minor suggestion swap really and is, flows better and makes it funnier imo. but its pretty funny well done
I like you
Lmfao.


Anyway thanks for making me realize KD and Kyrie had to ask permission from Nets Legends Jeremy Lin and Brook Lopez to wear their numbers
Bars
Yea that was a tough break
Kyrie loves finally being able to play with a clutch player
I could immediately tell KD was gonna miss cause his legs went a little wild.  He got excited at the open look and just missed, it happens.
Can’t believe KD missed his in particular 10 feet out with nobody close.

That end goes the Nets way 7/10 times
KD's shot, though open, was a bit difficult. Kyrie's shot was wide open. I'm still shocked both missed though.
[deleted]
Plus durant missed ft after the possible and-1 ridiculous poster
"This is the first time in my career I’ve looked down and be like, ‘That motherf–ker can make that shot, too.’ And he’ll probably do it a lot easier,” Irving said of Durant.
Remember when Kyrie said he finally have someone who can hit clutch shots?
You love to see it
The they still played and shot well, their bench lost them the game. Not a single positive plus minus on the bench, but all the starters were positive.
Is Durant washed?  Can Durant take the Nets to a 9 seed?  Can you trust Durant to bring a team to a championship?
Those were definitely NOT bricks lol
looks like scottie brook's prayers were answered.
It doesn't matter, you usually dont want to rely on game winners regardless LMAO.
Kyrie dude lost themm thw game
Hell yeah we are, say hello to the Eiffel Tower for me
We’ve finally figured out this secret, watch out league
Believe it or not... this was a “good” game for old Scooty
Man has been a straight killer this season. Doing work for my fantasy team
Look at the scoring efficiency of Russ/Beal compared to Durant/Kyrie and it’s pretty bizarre that Washington won.
Defensive rebounds have killed us all season. JA is not a good rebounder tbh, and our team box outs have been terrible. JA needs to stop helping on every drive, and giving away paint position.
The Boxscore says we had 7 more.

EDIT: Oh oops, I thought your said rebounds.
More FGA or offensive possessions in total? Two different numbers.
They need to find a way for Kyrie not to end up in the paint against Rui/Bryant over and over again. They feasted on him, he had no business down there.
Truly the most secrit play
Nets totally missing the playoffs
the nets did too and succeeded
That shot by Westbrook man. He almost completely threw that game for them.
Westbrook scored 14 in the 4th but doesn’t matter because of one play
Westbrook in that 4th was like quintessential Russ. Dude was big volume like 15 points and 3 assists, but just about threw the game with a brain dead dumb ass play
Westbrook is just hilarious, i admire his confidence so much

7-25, Beal just hit a layup and he take a deep three and doesn't give a fuck about running back

The man has the brain of Einstein on NZT-48
Man watched that live and just searched for a comment like this, Wstbrook standing watching a brick. No IQ, no concetration play... so bad. 0 of a example for young players, that was a rookie move not a seasoned nba vet.
They won so it's gonna be overshadowed but goddamn that was moronic. Dude has learnt nothing
Oh he’ll take them
Damn you gon be ded
LMAO
Kyrie said KD will take that shot never said he could make it lol
I was genuinely shocked that he missed
KD is a choker
Everybody grab your wands!
Or KD in the midrange
Man isn't clutch
Our sucking curse is now yours!
UNDEFEATED IN 2021!

We going 67-5!!!

#LETTTTSSS GOOOOOO
We should have never been crowned when we have this huge turnover problem
bEsT bEnCh iN tHe lEaGuE
Any opinion about any team in the first 10-20 games is too early unless they've already done something in the playoffs
No they’re still a great team in which I want zero part of. It’s early
No, it’s everyone who crowned them and never did any research on this team. Any fan of this team knew rebounding and the lack of a bench would kill us
Yeah it was obvious, Lakers are in another tier. Nets need to trade offense for some defense.
LeBron sends his regards
Rui is leveling up this season
He shot a dumb 3 right when it would’ve fucked them, BUT this dude had like 15 points and 2 or 3 assists in the 4th

Edit: think it was 13 and 2

Edit: 14
I'm far from being a Westbrook stan, but I'm so fucking tired of this Westbrook slander. 

He was huge for the wizards in the 4th quarter.

I do agree that he needs to fix his shot selection, but he definitely didn't cost the wizards the game.
Did anyone watch the game? 

When Beal went to the bench at the end of the third and going into the 4th, Russ kept them in the game
Spoken like someone who saw one shot from the entire game. He kept us in the game while Beal and Bryant rested. I get people don’t like him but this has gone overboard.
Good lord the number of possessions where he settled for jump shots is too damn high!
Beal had an off shooting night, but late when he knew his shot wasn't falling he drove to the rim for a finish, and then fed Bryant the ball deep after drawing in the defense.  Russ just continued to chuck or stand around at the top of the key when he doesn't have the ball in his hands.
Russ had a better plus/minus than Beal
Beal pulled through
7-25 yikes
I hope he never shoots the ball from 3 again.
Noone ever won a scoring title playing next to Durant. Durant is the reason PG left OKC.
That 3 from Dame range made my jaw drop. Can't believe he did that.
He ain't even on my team anymore and I was still losing my mind watching this game.
Is it really a choke if they were down 90% of the game?
KD's clutch stats are bad
I mean I'm just glad he's playing the way he's playing coming off the worst injury possible
LeBron would've made that, KD
Eat Shit Kyrie
Lebron is a Wizards killer.
Allen should have been in during the clutch, lost some rebounds to byrant which lead to Washington taking the lead.
That part was a tough break. Being down to the Wizards with one possession left is the issue
Westbrook could be such a good player if he took half as many shots and committed to driving to the basket - period. That is a summary of his career.
Raul Neto is the GOAT!
Wash your mouth out!
His shot selection is just so fucking frustrating sometimes. I don’t know why he just can’t learn to take fewer shots he knows he’s awful at. He’s 32, why the fuck can he not learn this?
We all did, our coach still sucks.

We’ve been lucky our opponents have underestimated us and played like ass!
I think it's just because those misses in the clutch felt super predictable. Felt like we saw that a fair bit last year
Wiz 2-0 in 2021!

We are going undefeated!
just needs to drive more
Can’t choke a game when you barely had a lead to begin with
THOMAS MOTHERTRUCKING BRYANT IS WHY!
They called that foul on that clean Beal block.
We were lucky refs gave us a few ticky tack ones but overall refs were horrid both ways.
They took us one game so far but gave us this game
Im so confused
How about those bricks to close it out.  Just awful
I'm truly not trying to be reactionary, and I'm certainly not a Durant hater, but man I just don't think he's a player that can be on a championship team. Tonight he was 2-7, but looking beyond the stats and looking at his decision making it's just fucking awful. In the fourth he took so many shots, many of them threes above the break where the defense was just daring him to shoot. And of course he took the bait. He had a post up against Hachimura where he essentially froze out the rest of the offense and threw up a wild, awful brick that didn't even touch the rim. At this point is his career you would think he'd improve his offensive decision making but it just won't happen. He is who he is, for better or worse.
What a bunch of fucking losers I swear
Fuckin poverty franchises
You mean the Ernie Grunfeld Finals right?

Only one man could curse two clubs with such bad luck!
Imagine having Kyrie and Durant and being the worst team in NY 
😂
Not trying to be reactionary, but the east runs through us
[Wizards and Knicks fans currently](https://youtu.be/0BtOY3Wr2LU)
So are we
By God, that's Sam Presti and Trevor Ariza's music!
Any wing that can rebound will be huge for us
Might I interest them in a Jerami Grant
Literally after 2 games people were calling the Nets the deepest team in the league. They did lose Dinwiddie though
Which is funny since people were touting them as having one of the deepest benches in the league
Ya the main reason is Caris has looked bad on with his shot to start the season, and the others on the second untis shots are just not falling. If those start going in and Caris can pick it up it turns around. We are deep just struggling right now.
Ehhhhjhh, a lot of ISO
I feel like Kurucs needs more playing time. He's a good defender and should get more of a chance to perform.
Its not gonna matter as much in the playoffs when Durant and Kyrie will put in a lot more mins lol
They had more rebounds than us, lol. It’s just the fact we had 9 steals and they had **20** turnovers.
Lmao 23 more shots and won by 1.  
  
A win is a win though.  Still crazy how Brooklyn fucked up.
It's both. They have defensive issues when matched up against the contenders.
The reactionary takes were glorious
"so how could r/nba have been so wrong about the Nets?"
every year, the season starts, people overreact, people complain about people who overreact, midseason people, stop paying attention and watching games, season about to end, people start paying attention again to see who makes the playoff for the bottom seeds, playoff happens, people overreact on the first games of every series, people who had the right call from the first game act like they won the lottery when the series ends. Rinse and repeat.

At some point, you really need to learn how to ignore the usuals. The playoff overreactions and slam backs are fun though.
I mean, I'm sure it does, but not on r/nba
And the Dinwiddie Injury hit us hard.. but still out game needs some real development. LeVert looked really bad tonight (and ref calls but we)
Especially incorporating Russell Westbrook into your offense.

People acting like the Wiz were going for 0 wins this season.
And defence.
Reading these threads makes me understand why so many people lose money in the markets. People are so emotional and reactionary. There's zero sense of objectivity. If your take is a modest one you never get the upvotes - only the most one sided ones that people resonate with.
His comment isn't anything more than mocking a comparison to the historic Warriors squad
I mean no ones saying they’re not making the playoff, just that they won’t walk the east.
Literally the most rare
Its very rare to win 73 regular season games but not win the championship
Dimwiddle got hurt which in turn nuked the strength of your depth.
Saying they’re not the a 73-9 team is not an overreaction.
Kyrie's shot looked so rushed with ~7 seconds left. No idea why he just yeeted it. GG tho wizards!
These are the guys that think they're more clutch than Bron.
This shit... I knew this was gonna be a comment lmao
Oh lord, Skip and Shannon def about to have a whole segment about this tomorrow lol.
I think he just didn't have balance. He should've just gone all the way to the basket
7/11 more like.
He definitely wasn’t balanced on that shot, he was fading away.
Kyrie didn’t really set his feet and the close out was coming. It’s not an impossible shot, but it’s not like a clean catch and shoot look. He’s good enough to make it, but that’s not even a 40% look.
That tonk sound lol
Where can I issue a refund?
Will do, that username tho
Crazy to think that playing 3 of Neto, Beal, Westbrook, and Ish doesn't work even when you do it for like 20 minutes.
It’s simple - just shoot more
The other players on the court matter too. Bryant, Bertans, Lopez, Smith, and Neto combined for 54 pts on 68% TS. Also 20 TOs to 7 is huge.
That 35 footer late had me dying
Wasn't the shot clock bout to expire?
Jesus Christ you’re obsessed with Westbrook. You’re on every thread about him shitting on the guy. If you don’t like him why pay attention to him?
His decision making had me yelling at the tv screen.
Beal went 1/5 in the 4th for 2 pts.
And then bitches at a teammate about something...
And someone tit fuck said wands!
Cavs fan saying this?
Bruh you as a cavs fans should know that’s not true
And huge defensive problem 

You need KD and Kyrie to be perfect offensively every game
I think it was probably true before Dinwiddie got injured, but these last few games have really exposed how much he holds that bench together in terms of controlling the pace and running sets. I thought LeVert was still gonna feast but it's clear he needs Dinwiddie more than Dinwiddie needs him
That disingenuous one of their best player tore his ACL
Anyone who said that unironically clearly doesn’t know anything about this team
You should have seen the game thread during the Celtics-Nets preseason game.  Nuts.
Lack of bench? I read some stat somewhere that your bench had more games started/starter minutes than every other team by a significant margin and that your bench could pretty much be starters on many non-contender teams.

Was the stat wrong or am I tripping or what?
I think you guys are still gonna be nasty
He had 14 in the 4th quarter
No lmao of course no one watched the game. Everyone knows the real fun in the NBA isn’t watching the sport it’s running to the game thread and opening the  box score in the next tab and firing off your opinion.
No, people will hate on Every single mistake he made rather than seethe positives he did
Beal wasn't that great...
Westbrook should not be allowed to shoot 3s in the 4th quarter
Bro your username
Also a few drives where he insists on trying to finish through 3 defenders rather than kicking out to open shooters. Especially egregious considering the shooters Washington have
Got a huge steal and assist down the stretch too. And was a beast early in the 4th.
That's cool and all but I watched the game
Beal went 1/5 in the 4th scoring 2 pts
Is it extreme to say he would be an MVP candidate if we won the 5 fucking close games we threw?
Westbrook bricking that ill advised deep 3 and not getting back on defense was very westbrookian
He always does (aside from the fumble a few days ago)
Beal shot 9-25 so that's not much better ...
Then proceeds to pose for 3 seconds while TLC is already on the other side of the court lmao.

This game was a really entertaining shitshow from both teams.
It is
Chill, legend has it than whenever you mention neto that drew Gooden will learn a new word in Portuguese
That's fair, I guess finishing around the rim isn't an issue, it's shot selection.
This was a bad call (Why Brooks didnt challenge that its the real question)but man its was a rare sight how many bad calls were against the Nets
Man has just gotta accept that he’s mostly a paint scorer now 

Which is fine, he’ll still average 19-24ppg off that but on like 53% fg
C'mon this doesn't even make sense.  First off Durant was efficient, second of all Durant has a long history of being excellent from range and in isolation, both areas Russell has struggled mightily in his entire career.
Fucking wankers
Seriously though
Talk shit now, it only goes downhill from here on out for you guys.
Couldn't be us. The premiere franchises in the league.
Kyrie and KD ain't got shit on Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle
*KD + cash considerations has been traded for Julius Randle*
They called me a madman when I said Knicks going to the ship
I guess we are in the West now...
Is that where Trevor is? Man is going to end up playing for every team (and the Rockets one more time) before he retires.
For the low low price of all of your first round picks forever
Damn that'd be a great fit. 

Pls don't
Grant for Durant + Kyrie + several 1sts, only such a package can match grant's value.
That's a huge loss too tho, they needed to keep caris on the bench, Landry has been trash so far
I really thought we had the best bench in the league for a sec
Offensively easily. But Jarrett Allen is their only plus defender on the Bench lol
People were calling them historicity good. Comparing them to the Warriors at their best. 

Talked about how they might have some of the best depth ever lol
That was before Dinwiddie went down though.
TIL that steals don't count as turnovers
time is a flat circle
Verts looked bad since the Celtics game
You mean to tell me that /r/wallstreetbets is not a good source for advice?

Well, shit
“Harden good” gets 5 upvotes, “Westbrook trash” gets 100
TBF, 90% of the Wiz comments here are joking man.
We are still calling for our coaches head and we were lucky Nets played poorly.

You’ve gotta understand that when your team starts the season 0-5 that you need to take any W’s you can get.

That being said.
UNDEFEATED IN 2021! WE GOING ALL THE WAY BAYYYBBAAAYYYY!
Yup - I dabble in stocks with money I don't *need* (95% is in index funds, I'm not stupid).  I've actually done pretty well, but it's astounding how many people can't filter out the noise and obsess over dumb, short-term sh*t that doesn't matter.
I mean every year some team will win the chip, but only one team has won 73 regular season games in history. Checkmate atheists.
>No idea why he just yeeted it 

I mean, have you watched him in the last 5 years? He's always been a shoot-first guard
GG Brooklyn Bro
I'm just amazed we got the offensive rebound
It's good to leave some time for an offensive rebound in that situation.

It's even better if you score after the OR.
Bruh, I'm still wondering what he was going for at the end of the third quarter
the commentators were saying it’s better to get a shot up quickly so that if you miss you can maybe get an offensive rebound and get a 2nd chance opportunity which they did but KD missed his open shot. I think it was a good play by the nets just unlucky their 2 star players missed.
They missed one shot each, big deal.
Both of hit massively clutch shots in nba finals. That matters more than some bad luck in a regular season game.
Bron is like discreetly clutch. People just think he’s not clutch because of his style. He’s gonna make the highest efficiency play. He don’t take the Kobe Esque fadeaways because he knows he won’t make them.
Lebron has a game tying shot blocked vs the spurs and needed Kyle Kuzma to save him. What is this revisionism?
So clutch.
Investigate 3/11
Y’all really sent a first to get him and gonna have to send 2 or 3 to move him lol
Do you not partake?
The shot is one thing. Not being aware that his man who jump contested his shot is now alone on the other side of the court is just real dumb. He was holding his pose just trying to look cool.
there was 6 seconds left.
Russ Derangement Syndrome is real and it affects thousands of nephews every day
10 assists/2 turnovers and 14 points in the 4th quarter
Hell yeah brother
Speaking statistically of course.
making a shot in the clutch=/=being clutch in general
We actually have a pretty decent opposing eFG%. The problem is that we suck at limiting turnovers for free easy buckets and are struggling on the offensive glass, so teams are able to beat us through sheer shot volume. We lost by 1 here but Washing had 23 more FGA despite shooting worse.

Our defense is good at forcing bad shots but horrible at limiting opposing possessions
I’m unfamiliar with the stat you’re referring to but Dinwiddie was a MAJOR loss to the team, Levert has always been inconsistent but everyone loves him and thinks he’s automatic, Allen is good but shouldn’t be on the bench to begin with.
He shot 7 for 25. Listen, I get it, he gets way too much hate--but if he kept them in the game that quarter, it follows that he kept them OUT of it the other three  

edit: lol @ downvoters not understanding that clutch performance in one quarter doesn't undo damage done previous to that stretch
I want a federal law specifically making it illegal unless we’re up by 70
I love to contradict data with “my feelings”
Don’t bother r/nba thinks +/- is what matters. Anyone who watched the game knows Russ sucked.
[deleted]
MVP candidate this early doesn’t really matter - the narrative hasn’t started favoring anyone yet and likely won’t for another 20+ games. 

But yes.
Bryant played amazing at least
Gooden right now....

“estrondo estrondo!!!”
I’m used to us being the ones on the receiving end of bad calls.

Was shocked when Kyrie got called for that foul on Russ where Russ bodied him.
 C'mon this doesn't even make sense. First off Westbrook won, second of all Westbrook has a long history of being excellent from range and in isolation, both areas Durant has struggled mightily in his entire career.
DID HE JUST FOK SMASH MY BALL?
r/formula1 is leaking
Harden for Westbrook straight up come on don’t be a pussy let’s go
We coming for you boiiiiii!
You mean titanic? No wonder it never came
Aren’t you guys still tanking?
I thought Trust the Process was still going on?

East runs through Knicks/Cavs/Wizards
I didn't even know we had him. He hasn't stepped on the floor. Is this an Iguodola situation?
They got last year's Shamet
I've only seen a few games but why don't they stagger Kyrie and KD more? It feels like the games I've watched would be competitive and then they both sit and fall behind by double digits.
We did. And then someone capable of 20 points any given night went down.
Does TLC start? He’s solid
Dwight Howard?
PLTR moon, dips for a couple of days, PLTR short short, sell sell
It's less the Wizards and much more the takes on the Nets (as described by the posts i've responded to)
> “One thing I’ve always been comfortable with is, I’ve felt like I was the best option on every team I’ve played for down the stretch. This is the first time in my career where I can be like “that motherf*** can make that shot, too.”
It was totally on brand for him dont get me wrong, I meant I just still have no idea why he's like that lmao
GG netsbros you guys are gonna be sp00ky in a few years :\^)
It's not just one shot. All these bricks KD and Kyrie have at the end of games is why their clutch stats are significantly worse than Lebron's.
In a fucking regular season game too lmao
I think KD also missed the game tying FT earlier. But overall yes you’re right, not a big deal this early on
It's not revisionism to say Lebron is more clutch than Kd though that's just the stats.
Stop it Skip.
Heavily Protected 1st.
If we are in the lottery we keep it.
Some say he is still holding that pose til this day
Passed well but still pretty poor shot selection.
Shotwise it was poor tho. Not complaining too much we managed a W but damn
Westbrook will make a horrific basketball play and nearly cost his team a big win, and OKC fans will still be stanning him in the comments. I respect the dedication.
Dude had 24 points on 31 shooting possessions
7 threes taken one made, 25 shots, 7 makes

OKC fans are weird man, still defending him
Oh I haven’t seen his stats in the crunch time so you’re probably right but I’d trust kyrie to hit that shot when it truly matters
I think using opposing eFG% this early into the season is a pretty flawed way to judge your defensive abilities 

From the games I’ve watched the small ball lineups are horrible defensively and it just looks like lay up lines for the other team.

Hard to stay engaged defensively as well if you keep having the turnovers and people running out against you.
You deeply misunderstand the data if you think a single game +/- (that is a difference of literally 2 points) is indicative of which players played worse/better.
A single game +/- isn't really indicative of performance...
They were more important than the Bryant points to put them up 1 with 15 seconds left?
Ok dude.  I'm clearly not gonna have a logical discussion with you.
Have fun with westbrook. All heart but also just empty stats. Harden drama is bullshit and hopefully we don't get simmons
Damn u fucking killed him btw WEST SIDE ON TOP WE PMPY TAKE DUBS NO Ls
It amazes me that 2 people up top can't see the joke.  Its as obvious as the Wizards being the best team in the East, and yet, wooosh.
I think the team and ariza agreed that he doesn’t have to report to the team.
Honestly i don’t wanna shit on Steve Nash like everybody else does right now but it feels like we literally have no game plan. We just hope KD and Kyrie hit their shots or wait for a double team and kick it out to the open shooter. Nobody drives in and we run no plays
Because Dinwiddie, LeVert and Allen had so much chemistry together that original bench was basically like a second starting lineup. Taking out Dinwiddie means they have to completely change their offensive gameplan and there are going to be some serious growing pains.
he's on the sixers
its okay rocky, take your time
Yikes, the disrespect to Kevin Love
Came here for this comment
r/agedlikemilk
Yep. If LeBron misses those shots, it’s one of the top segments on “undisputed.” 

KD & Kyrie miss? Won’t even see a segment on the show... 🙄
i remember more clutch finals shots from kyrie and kd than bron. i really dont think of any memorable shots from bron tbh. im not disputing your stats just there's no specific shot you would fire up from bron while there are from those 2
Too many jumpshots!
Beal shot 9-25 and Russ shot 7-25
Makes no sense. Russ has been ass.
He also had 14 points in the 4th quarter
How is it weird for OKC fans to defend their former franchise player? That's like giving Bulls fans shit for defending Derrick Rose.
2 of those 3’s came because of an expiring shot clock and a halftime half court lob.
Beal shot 9-25... That's not infinitively better... They just put up 123 points on a poor shooting night (41%)
His shooting percentages go way down in these situations.
Kyrie shot 33% in the clutch in the 2016 finals
For sure I’m not saying it’s perfect, but I think even when you dig into the advanced metrics this early, our efficiency on a per possession basis is pretty average, I’m pretty sure someone showed me that our per possession efficiency was like 13th or something. Not great but not totally garbage either.

The problem is that we just allow sooooo many opposing possessions that teams are able to brute force points on us
because you are the one without any knowledge
Go eat a dick lmao
But we ARE the best in the bEASTERN Conference?

We aren’t losing another game. I’ll even give you a famous quote.

“I’m speaking it into existence!” 
-LaVar Ball....Michael Scott
So yes
Can you imagine your boss telling you don't bother coming to work.

We'll still pay you a couple million though.
I don’t get how that’s possible with the coaching depth you have. It’s not just Nash, it’s MDA, Udoka, Stoudemire, Vaughn, Harrington...
Oh fuck right lol
Put some respecc on JR Swish’s name
Guarantee to hear about Ray Allen too.
Don’t watch it then.

Won’t have to see segments for any kind of scenario.
Last time I checked KD and Kyrie didn’t call themselves “the greatest basketball player of all time” after they won a ring. That talk comes with added criticism.
Here: https://streamable.com/81p3b0

Basically the same shot as Durant's but without the hype. Because the Heat were already up in the series.
That’s awful for both of them
Is that supposed to be a point in favor of Russ somehow?
Yes, for 24 points on 31 possessions overall.

Look I honestly like the guy. He plays very hard and is passionate, but he makes some of the dumbest decisions Ive ever seen a player of his calibre make.

He has no business taking that many shots. It’s just terrible offense.
Because you can be a fan of a player and acknowledge their glaring flaws?

You don't have to be deluded
Maybe the problem is this coaching depth. It is nearly impossible that they will be on the same side always, they may have their conflicts over their ideal gameplans. As Nash is a rookie coach, maybe assistants are more involved than they should be.
Me neither man but I’m sure they will figure it out
The problem is idiots watch it and Idiots are loud and create narratives.
Oh shut up. The talk was already there before it.

And it will still be there long after. Don't be disingenuous.
basically the same shot except there is 3 minutes left and its not in the face of a superstar. Downvote me all you want but KD and kyrie certainly have more memorable clutch shots than lebron
Yet Russ still scored 14 points in the fourth
He was the entire offense in the 4th that won them the game
I hope this isn't a repeat of Kidd/Lawrence Frank scenario...
That criticism was minimal before the Heatles. I think it’s more disingenuous to act like Lebron is a victim. A great player? Definitely. But there’s a reason he’s so heavily criticized.
Alright, but that’s still awful for both of them lol
And they would have been in front if Westbrook wasn’t so bumass early in the game.
Lebron is the most clutch player in NBA history. He has the most game winners. So there is no valid criticism
Well I mean Kyrie and KD released that podcast throwing shade at LeBron for not being clutch when he's literally the most clutch player ever. They're going to get criticized for it and deservedly so.

LeBron has been scrutinized since high school. He was scrutinized before and after those comments. LeBron only ever called himself the GOAT once, it's not like doesn't have an argument. But he's shown maturity after this latest championship and said it's not for him to decide when he was asked about it again.

Kyrie and KD have huge egos and have lots of media, lockeroom, and leadership problems.
Ja true
Lol

The dude was wondering why if Lebron 
missed a game winner he would be criticized more than Kyrie and KD. I explained why. 

And I never said Kyrie and KD shouldn’t face criticism. After all it comes with the territory. But it’s not some mystery why Lebron faces more.

Also, “literally the most clutch ever”?  Kobe had 8 buzzer beaters and Jordan had 9. Lebron has 7. If you want to cherry pick playoff stats or shots that put his team ahead you can. But “literally the most clutch ever” is not objectively true. 

Regardless Pippin put it best. Hard to hit a game winner when you’re up by 10.
Um no. Everyone already analyzed this and concluded that LeBron had the highest clutch FG%, clutch shots made in history, and playoff game winners made in history. LeBron has 17 FGM in clutch situations and he ranks #1 in history. 

You can't just cherry pick buzzer beater and use those lmfao. LeBron has the most playoff buzzer beaters and most shots made in clutch situations which is the last 2 minutes of the game down 3-5 points.

Comparing just LeBron and Kyrie, here the CLUTCH TIME numbers of the 3 years LeBron and Kyrie were together, playoff games, 4th quarter, final 5 minutes, game within 5 points 

LeBron: 58-136 (eFG 46.7%)

Kyrie: 28-78 (eFG 41.7%)

Those were just the PLAYOFF numbers. Here are their CLUTCH TIME numbers in the finals. (Keep in mind, Kyrie was injured in 2015.)

LeBron: 8-19 (eFG 47.4%)

Kyrie: 4-16 (eFG 28.1%)

So yes, "literally the most clutch player" is objectively true.

And we're not talking about when your up by 10 or whatever Pippen said, we're talking about close and clutch situations which LeBron has shown he's the best at those statistically.

And I wouldn't trust a old head like Pippen who chooses a new GOAT every year. He said it was LeBron, then Wilt, then MJ, he's too fickle minded.
“Everyone” = a bunch of Lebron fan boys on Reddit and Lebron’s PR team. 

I don’t care about Kyrie’s clutch numbers. 

I will say It is hilarious to me that to find something Lebron has the GOAT stat on everyone has to dive so far off into the weeds. 

I bet Lebron has scored the most points ever on a Tuesday when there’s a full moon and it’s 67 degrees outside too. 

There is one stat I do know he’ll have at the end of the season. Most all time turnovers in NBA history. Pretty impressive.
>“Everyone” = a bunch of Lebron fan boys on Reddit and Lebron’s PR team. 

Nope, major news outlets like ESPN even proved this

>I don’t care about Kyrie’s clutch numbers.

You sure did seem to care enough to defend him and KD even though they released those toxic statements

>I will say It is hilarious to me that to find something Lebron has the GOAT stat on everyone has to dive so far off into the weeds. 

It's not that deep if you know how to google search lol. Keep hatin'

>I bet Lebron has scored the most points ever on a Tuesday when there’s a full moon and it’s 67 degrees outside too. 

Lol we're talking about clutch situations and you're trying to make this look like an ESPN stat. Lmao you're just salty and giving off LeBron hater vibes rn

>There is one stat I do know he’ll have at the end of the season. Most all time turnovers in NBA history. Pretty impressive.

Good to know you're not even a Nets fan and you're just a full blown LeBron hater. Playing more seasons and being the focal playmaker & scorer in the offense obviously means more turnovers lmao.

He'll also have the most points all time, LeGOAT.
You sited ESPN. Then called them a joke later in the same post. Lol. Nice bud. nice.
I knew that would be the only thing you'd catch lmao, I put there on purpose. Speaks to the surface level reading you did. I didn't even call them a joke, just referred to it as an "ESPN stat". ESPN does indeed manufacture very specific stats from time to time, but that doesn't mean their stats aren't accurate.

Knowing how to differentiate is an important skill. Lol. Nice bud. Nice.
This game is further proof that the All-Star game should not happen. Only fitting that it was a nationally televised game.
SIAKAM SPINNING HIS WAY TO 33 POINTS
BANDAGE LOWRY
[POV: you're a Nets/Raptors player heading back in the locker room] (https://i.imgur.com/mlYe6v4.png)
Hopefully we didn't just witness a super spreader event. Kyle Lowry channelling his inner Nelly. I'm going to go listen to Country Grammar now.
Harden and Kyrie with a combined 7 points on 2/7 shooting after KD exited the game with 9 minutes to go in the 3rd.
Raptors looking good. Spicy P may be back on the menu
Lowry really uses his whole 6'0" frame like a battering ram.
Between the terrible officiating and the confusing events regarding KD’s contact tracing, this game was a wild ride.
OG Anunoby? OG Bembry...
One of Lowrys best games, can’t hate
i loved how brown talked shit to Norman after a basket on him just to see the rest of the raptors abuse him in the defensive and offensive end till the end of the game
The Raptors have quietly won three straight, are currently the 8 seed in the East and Spicy P has scored 30+ in three of his last four games. Look out, they comin'
In a game against 3 first ballot hall of famers, it's the 4th hall of player, 34-year old Kyle Lowry that is the best player on the floor. So, business as usual.
DOES STEVE NASH KNOW WHAT TIMEOUTS ARE
Its sad that what could've been one of the most competitive games of the season was marred by awful officiating and inconsistent Health and Safety protocols.

Bad look NBA.
Both teams lost today with that officiating 

Also, I think NBA's incompetency handling the COVID situation with KD shows that an All-Star game should not be held this season
Mans bleeding all over the place, referee circus going on, Typhoid Durant rubbing up all over them, still pulled out the win. Raptors against the world.
Lowry forever and ever
kyle lowry n'est pas un tireur de tache, il ne doit pas courir dans le coin pour tirer comme une chienne de 3e option, ce n'est pas un putain de dieu humain steph curry reviens seulement cette fois il n'est pas une putain de chatte tirée du putain de logo et te battre en même temps
Jesus Christ what was the NBA thinking letting KD play tonight.
I hope this means my guy Siakam is back, has he looked better lately Raptors fans?
That Covid testing shit that happened with KD gave me big Dez Bryant vibes. That was so weird.
**DONT POKE THE BEAR**
The Nets beat the Clippers and lose to Raptors and Wizards, just as planned.

Siakam becoming washed was greatly exaggerated.
We all knew the Raps are better then their record. But, Turnovers that we made with lazy passing, and Orebs at the end just cost us this game bad. Overall though some bright spots from the Nets. Harden shooting 8 times is mindblowing though lmao.
really liking this new siakam that barely shoots 3s
So Toronto destroys KDs Achilles, and in return he's gonna give em all Covid....
Harden took 8 shots in 40 minutes of playing time. What the fuck.
Bruce Brown flexing when everyone was scoring on him was pretty funny
Nets playing 4D chess with this KD thing, losing on purpose so the Raptors will be too good to trade Lowry to us. 

look into it 👀
Raps guard and wing defense is amazing. Kyrie and Harden invisible most of the night. Raps would be among the top teams in the east if they could get anything from their starting 5
Jeff green with the most shots tonight for the nets as everyone expected
Kyle lowry is 35 years old btw
said it in the game thread but this is the EXACT reason the canadian govt didn't trust the nba/nhl/mlb to make good decisions/follow protocols. what a shambolic fucking game for the nba. the horrible reffing making the game unwatchable for LARGE chunks. the mass exposure to a fucking epidemic.

it sucks that we have to play in tampa. but it's the right call. the guys are too fucking dumb and money hungry to be trusted to make the right decisions over x period
Nets games are looking like it is first to 120 wins the game.
this was crazy ass game

refs tho...
Man, Siakam seems to be getting it together again. Hard carried us in the third quarter.
Kyle Lowry is the best Raptor of all time.
Cue Masai fuck Brooklyn

Love to see Pascal continue to trend in the right direction and the Raps really just needed a win. Even without KD the nets just have so much offensive firepower
What a good game to win, shame about Durant. Can’t catch a break against us.
KYLE LOWRY
So KD pretty much came back, got 4 fouls, and infected 2 teams...

Noice!
I think we all need eye bleach after this game wow
Kyle Lowry was the best hall of famer on the court tonight
We just got out hustled. Losing durant didn’t help but they were just putting in the effort at the end of the game and it showed.
this whole game was a biiig asterisk between protocols/reffing but man.

 kyle lowry and pascal siakam demanding respect on national TV - you really love to see it
# #FreeMe
In what world do Harden and Kyrie combine for 20 fga?
Dont let nobody tell you the raptors arent a threat
Adam silver. Your biological war fare can’t stop us!!!

(Hope KD tests comes back negative)
Siakam been balling recently
Old man Lowry showing out tonight
The RAPTORS did this without OG who is one of the best defensive players in the NBA.Tomorrow is the 6th of the month so they can trade a couple of players that they couldn't before the 6th.Count on them trading and getting a big up front  that can play D.
This shit felt like a playoff game AND I'M ALL FOR IT
Did they change the rules about when a team can sub in a player? At one point in this game the raptors were in-bounding the ball after a Nets made basket and the refs blew the whistle to allow the Nets to make a substitution. Shouldn't the Nets have needed to take a timeout(when they had possession) or wait for a dead ball?

I watch a lot of basketball and have never seen this happen but the announcers didn't say anything about it so I'm just confused.
was that a basketball game or a circus?
This game gave me life 🙌
[Raptors on their way to a top 4 seed.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SLU3oG_ePhM)
This makes me happy
i thought the Raptors were tanking? WTF!
I’m not saying we have a chance to win, or even all that good, but I wouldn’t wanna play us in the first round.
Freddy had a bad game offensively but still played a very solid game on defense.The refs were terrible, what's the deal with that on a nationally televised game?It's  total BS if they don't cancel the all-star game after the KD bullshit.
Well this was easily the least fun I've had watching a basketball game maybe ever...
Joe Harris just can't win with these cats
Regarding KD: basically he didn't have to sit out the start of the [game](https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1357887705233948672?s=19)
KD coming in after not being cleared and then taken out after they realized they were right the first time is fucked, why did they continue the game when essentially every single player and game side staff could be potentially exposed. 

Nice we won I guess, but would prefer the league be more careful at this rate.
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
A DUB ON NATIONAL TV

I LIKE THAT
Kyle is one special player man. 36 years old.
on one hand: w h y  


on the other: I'm really happy for the Raptors
KD better not fucking test positive.
Are we the best bad team or the worst good team
This was a tough game to stomach. I don't care if you're a Raps fan, Nets fan, or neutral fan. This was an absolute shitshow amplified by the officiating.

They should've deleted this game midway through the 2nd quarter.
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
That was terrible refereeing
So KD out for a week? Fuck this night...
KLOE
LEEEET’S GOOOO!
Thicc daddy Lowry getting it done with his dad dick energy fuck ya holy moly
Weirdest game of the year. Also KD out for the fourth by Kyrie only takes one shot???
Durant disappeared and so did Harden and Irving
I don't understand how you can take 1 player out AFTER he has been on the court warming up and not take out the entire team. 

lmao jk national tv game commercial money go brrr
Can’t wait for BBallBreakDown video.
Nets had almost 9 players in double figures and still managed to lose
It's tough when every games a road game but the raps are climbing back in this.
Raptors winning when KD leaves early is a nostalgic feeling.
Does Kyrie look much older in the face? I swear he is.
I hate and love the raptors
Toronto gonna be a tough out as a 7-8 seed.
When your offense is like butter that's a complement.

When your defense is like butter, not so much.

Nets looking like Kerry Gold right now
kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
Fuck Brooklyn
Best defensive backcourt in the NBA vs the worst. When you MFers gonna learn defense wins championships!!!🏆
Durant and leaving court during a game against raptors. Name a better duo.
KD 8 points. Washed!
FUCK BROOKLYN AND FUCK YOUR BIG 3. LOWRY AND STEADY FREDDY ALL THE WAYYY
2nd round preview I hope 🤞🏻
Fuck Brooklyn.
kd be cryin like a bitch
What's the over-under on the league quarantining the Raps and Nets? Someone check Fanduel for me.
All because they didn't free Durant
Raps came with it from the start. Slowly but surely creeping back into the playoff picture.

edit: just realized theyre already in 7th with the win lol
Why are mods blocking posts about Durant calling out NBA
When Jeff Green takes 33% more shots than Harden takes or Durant takes, you will always get an L.
the nets can beat any team in the league or lose to any team in the league on any given night
Why are Bruce Bowen, Jeff Green and Landry Shamet taking more shots than Harden?
Suck it bk
Bruce Bowen came back from retirement and signed with the nets!
Very wet game indeed
Damn COVID don’t wanna see the nets shine
Can’t believe they initially held back, then played, then finally pulled KD in the 3rd. If he’s positive he already infected both teams at that point.
Pascal Siakam: People keep asking if I'm back and I haven't really had an answer, but yeah, I'm thinking I'm back.
Why don’t both teams have to quarantine? Eli5
At this point Durant has to think the Raptors have his voo-doo doll or something.
Kyle vs everybody
[kyle lowry ain't no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time](https://streamable.com/o0pbnb)
I rather play every game on the road instead of tampa
Nice game from kyrie LUL
Raptors Fan thoughts on the game after my first time seeing the Nets big three play :

Why the fuck did the Nets sign KD/Kyrie and trade for Harden only to let Harden take 8 shots in 40 minutes while giving 11 to Landry Shamet and 12 to Jeff Green?

 How do you expect to win anything when you're giving up 97 FG and only getting 80?  You're turning the ball over and giving up offensive rebounds like crazy and I don't see how the nets can fix it without another trade. Sure, KD only played 19 minutes, but the Raptors were missing OG.

The Nets depth looks bad after all the trades and signings. You need better supportive defenders.
Can someone make a petition to promote d’antony to head coach cuz I’m losing my mind rn
KD playing less than a half agaisnt the Raptors has become sort of a tradition.
Stopped watching after they told KD he couldn’t play. After not letting him play until 4:13 in the 1st 

Beyond frustrated with NBA at this point
Typical nets, not getting up for sub .500 teams
Lol
Does KD have the Fiji Flu?? (Rocket power homies will know)
Something just ain’t right with this nets team. Also why tf does KD keep getting into this protocol shit?
I'm glad the league got embarrassed on national TV after getting called out about the All-Star Game all week
Kd coming back and forth was so ridiculous
This game is further proof that Kyle Lowry is an All-Star
30+ in 3 of his last 4 👀
No turnovers, either. His playmaking has gotten way better, but he’s usually still good for one or two bonehead TOs per game.
Nash and D'Antoni  spending years studying offense when they could've just used spinning
Spincycle P
Twirling! Twirling! TWIRLING toward ~~freedom~~ victory!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eLfRf9Os7I
Spicy bayblade
Is he starting to get his mojo back from last season?
He hit a lot of fadeaway jumpshots in the jump, he finally has a counter to his spin move
LIKE A RECORD BABY
Looking like Nelly
Don't poke the bear
MMMM HOT SHIT
They let the game go on so they'd have enough time to call in Chernobyl crew
Gonna rock my Air Force 1s all weekend
They needed to social distance
i dont know what kyrie was doing but for harden raptors defense if you remember last year throws bodies at the star and makes role players beat them so that shouldnt be too surprising. he was making the right reads
Why did Harden only take 8 shots the entire game?
Why did they take only 7 shots?
Always was.
Siakam struggles against quick wings that he can't bully in the paint or scoot around. Jaylen brown shut him down last year in the playoffs and he resorted to mid range jumper bricks. He's gotta work on that part of his game.
Plays like a 6'0 center
The first half was the worst officiated half I have ever watched. Luckily it settled down a bit early in the third.
Where was OG??
OG stanley
He was on a mission late in the 4th. Was not losing that game
He heard nephews talking trash about him being washed at 35.
He’s always had our number
Sneaky good rebounder considering his height. Pretty sure he was our top rebounder earlier in the season
I think my favourite part too was when brown pointed to his headband being on an angle to get a foul call when Lowry & Powell were both bleeding and got nothing for it... thank god that call was overruled
I saw the shit talking and had to ask myself: "who tf is this Bruce Brown fella??"

He sounds like a Fortnite POI
If you fuck with Norm God, you fuck with all the Raps lmao
yea i still dont know who that midget is
ssshhhhhh, we are actually tanking
Imagine if we didn't blow a million double digit leads in the first 10 games
We been slowly coming along. It's been nice to see. Championship dna still there. Need a center
In general the Raptors seem to be putting it together the past 10 games or so. I'm pretty confident they'll get the 6th seed in the end (maybe even 5th).
7th now, Jazz beat the Hornets.
When Utah beats Charlotte in the next few minutes we'll be the sixth seed.
If you look at the point differentials, they've been positive even though they have a negative record. The return was seemingly inevitable.
The Raps are tied for the 6th spot after tonight. 

I think they're like a half game back of 5th now
They’ll end up with a top 4 seed
7th seed
Two of those wins were against the magic who we’ve now beat the last 10 times we played them so those are free wins. This is still a first round exit team until further notice.
Careful mentioning Lowry as a hall of famer on here, don't want people trying to argue with you that he's not based solely on their personal feelings.
KD was best on the floor, but they barely let him play then took him down lol

The Nets were down 6 when he came and up 4 when he left and were clearly gaining.
if this was NN... we'd be cooking him up and calling for his head LOL
Hes just more of a patriot than he is a coach
Did they really still have all their timeouts in the 4th? They had a successful challenge on one but when I saw the timeout graphic late game I thought it had to be a glitch.
Nash has not been a very impressive coach.
He sucks man
Worst ref crew in the league so far
Typhoid Durant LMAO
Refs were playing "no blood, no foul" but without the "no blood" part
Meanwhile Nets shot 30 FTs and the Raptors only shot 14
You forgot "no OG"
Raps MVP: Bruce Brown
Typhoid durant hahaha
EasySuperSpeader
Typhoid Durant... 😂🤣🤣

Awwwwouaisssss?
Hon hon hon my baguette
When you are famous, they let you do it.
'Merica
He's had 30 points in 3 of the last 4 games.
Better decision-making for sure and looks more confident in his game.
Yeah, ever since the suns game like a month ago he's been back. Idk what it was, but his energy just changed on defense, no more foul trouble and a lot of energy. Also on the offense he stopped forcing shots and just started playing his game + got very good vision on double teams.
In my opinion outside of the first handful of games he's looked really solid if not great since then. I think he's realising he doesn't need to be THE guy every night and it's opening his comfort level up. At the same time his playmaking looks vastly improved and against certain teams he can cook them on the inside.
Yes. Much better.
Yes.

He basically doesn't shoot threes, so he isn't quite as threatening as last season, but he is driving to the basket a lot, rebounding well, and his ~~midrange~~ spin-shot game is elite. He is probably a better playmaker than before, too.
His playmaking has gotten unbelievable
The Raptors stopped playing him like a crappy floor spacer and are feeding him in the mid post area where he can attack. He's finally got some confidence back finishing on the inside as well.
I think so. He's fully healthy and he recently said that he's not forcing dumb perimeter shots anymore, and focusing on driving to the rim more
He's definitely got a nagging groin injury that effects his lateral movement, but his shot selection is way better so that helps. I think once he gets fully healthy (maybe next yr) he will bring back the consistent jumper that we were use to.
Keep in mind the Nets don't have any good wing defenders. In fact, they don't have any wing defenders. In fact, they don't have any defenders. In fact, they don't believe in defense
He’s improved his passing during the offseason. He had a rough patch scoring but I could still tell he was working on his game. If he can continue his recent form we may see him get a few triple doubles this year
What happened there?
Except he played most of the game, Dez didn't even play at all.
KD too scared to play us a whole game
I mean technically he destroyed his own Achilles
We won a championship, but at what cost?
No, the Warriors destroyed KD's achilles.
Raps were showing doubles and traps at him every possession, he made a ton of great passes for layups and threes
That’s the Fred VanVleet effect.  He just stays in your pocket all game long.
Raps play hard help defense vs stars. Give up open 3 to role players sbut shutdown the stars.
Man had 12 assists, was absolutely making great passes when the help defence came over. 


Kyrie I honestly didn’t realize was in the game at all in the second half
8 shots is wild, although harden doesn't usually shoot a bunch against Nurses defense
I haven't really had time to watch Nets games. Wtf, I know he's the only facilitator, but that doesn't look right to me.
StopTheLowrySteal
Stay woke
Give us ben....
Nah I can't see lowry leave us
Prices just up but were holding 💎🙌
1 Ben Simmons please.
Baynes hasn't been playing like an inuksuk recently and we're (very) slowly climbing up, so...
Not until March, but still.
I don't see how they didn't trust the NHL, they had their playoffs all in Canada and the North division has played all their game without problem so far. There's also an american AHL team moving to Calgary for the year to play their season there.

What the Canadian government didn't want is travel accross the border.
Harris is a walking 3pt. I cannot believe how many buckets he gets. Hustles too.
He was gonna play cautiously anyways, with 4 fouls (5 really, but refs suck)
Ref ball is hard to watch
Yah it was rough to watch. Touchy on the technicals, missed fouls, calling fouls that weren’t there....I’m a bit surprised no one got tossed because the potential was there
That cures eye-covid, right?
he’s not a HOFer by any means, but if you’re joking than i’m sorry and i’ll accept my r/woooosh
Rockets flair🧐
How long have you been a Nets fan?
In a world where Raps tailor their defense to shut you down.
I mean, our main defensive strategy is to get the ball out of their star’s hands and force the role players to beat us.
For the past 8 years, if your role players don’t hit all their shots then the Raptors beat you.  

Choke out the ball handler and secondary scorer and leave open the role players.
Double the initial ball handler, let them swing to the corner for a look from Harris, Shamet, TLC, or Green
Same universe where Clippers are Bums.
Defense won't cause them to shoot less. I doubt they'll shoot less playoffs just bec of Defense. Maybe theyre experimenting.
I mean we didn’t have KD either
Could be a 3-6 preview for sure. Would be a fun series.
Pretty sure that was just an out of bounds play.
I want to fight Natalie Sago. I am a woman btw.
EVERY GAME IS A NATIONAL GAME WHEN YOU'RE CANADIAN BABYYY
The worst good team.

This team is still fundamentally the same crew that won in 2019, and had the second best record overall last year. It is, at its core, a good team.

But, our only superstar walked after a half season, we lost a high-level role player in Green, we replaced our aging-but-skilled centre rotation with a pair of traffic cones and a ragdolling stick figure (granted, that last one actually kinda worked). Add to that that our previously good bench has either stepped into a starting role to replace what we lost (OG, FVV), been traded (RHJ, Ibaka), or regressed (Davis, Powell?), and we haven't been able to replace it, and we are a husk of our former selves.
5th seed, book it.
Of course Padraic the Celtics fan usin that Kerry Gold!  Top man.
Yes, but not as much as playing injury depleted opponents in the Finals!!!
Have an upvote.
The only way that can happen is if you guys drop out of first, though. Raps pretty much locked into the 4/5 spot at this point.
Cause Nick's defence focuses on the big guns and lets the rest of the team have at it.
The sad part is even with all that raptors barely managed to squeak out a win when kd had half a game
Typical Nets- losing to the Raptors as per normal.
Feels so strange having our team called sub 500
Nail in the coffin would be if KD tweets that he'll sit out the AS game if selected.
The Return of the Beyblade
The Revenge Tour
And a ton of assists too
He's gotten comfortable with using the post up as a passing tool now rather than looking for his own shot, so many turnovers came from getting doubled before
Just like every star in this league. As long as it’s not 3-4 like some stars do then it’s all good. Kyrie had a good 7 head scratchers tonight.
I think he was trying to do too much when he was in a rut.
His dribble seems to be tighter, seems like he is very aware of that most defenders are looking to strip him early
D'Antoni currently devising the Seven Spins or Less offence after watching this game.
It is a good trick.

This fucking goes jfc
In a big way.
Looking like Fred
That thing became popular in 7th grade for some reason and everyone at school was rockin one
Chris Tucker
It's getting hot in here
3.6 Ronas, not great, not terrible.
I'm gonna blast my thermostat way up!
Harden was absolutely making the right reads, made absolute sense why he took less shots when literally every Raptor was swarming him. 

Kyrie was weird, I barely even noticed his presence in the second half lmao not sure if it's a by product of Harden taking over ball handling or something else
Our D tends to over help on teams with a superstar like Harden. Playing the whole "let the other players beat you" defense. Which is why we got roasted when Durant is out there too and the D couldnt load up on anyone.
Raptors defense.  Basically they'll heavily guard star players, and let the players with low percentages get open looks.  The defense really crumbles when an entire team is hot, which you could see in the Celtics series last year.
He saw a lot of double teams and a decent amount of box-and-one. The Raptors always throw a bunch of different looks at him to try and make him a passer. He was serving up dimes tonight too, Nets missed a lot of great looks off of his penetration.
Im gonna say Raptors Defense.
Lots of doubles above the arc
We were throwing multiple bodies at harden and denying kyrie the ball. We always try to shut down the stars and make the role players beat us.
Norm Powell
Defence.  Hard to recognize it in the NBA these days though.
they were getting doubled
FVV and Lowry defence.

It’s hard to shoot when Fred is in your pocket
They looked like they didn't feel like being out there after KD left. Heart of a champion lol
You're telling me a player going thru a short slump isnt completely washed and the worst signing you've made in years?
Injured still
Scarf injury
Been out with a calf injury.
Calf is sore atm
Injured
Right here
11 pts in last 5 minutes

Plus 2 ast and 1 orb
#washedbooty
He’s never forgiven you guys for 2014.
It was funny cause it was his own arm that displaced his headband.
MMMM Busters Brownce - Illinois State
Damn you don’t know your own chubby pg?
The spice must flow. Quietly for Cade
this team has way too much talent to not make the playoffs
Got us to waive Len and Baynes to get half his shit together tho.
A 10 point lead in the 1st quarter is not exactly “blowing it”
We would have a million wins in the first 10 games?
Been telling folks for a while that you guys were going to turn things around and it's finally happening. When you guys were 2-8 or whatever, you guys were actually up in 7 of those 8 losses, and the lone exception was at Golden State, where you guys made a big comeback before losing in the final seconds. The amount of doom and gloom about you guys in the first few weeks of the season was nuts and now, those people are quiet as can be.
If the rumors that the Cavs will sooner or later buy Drummond out are true, then I wish you guys sign him, the Nets getting him would be repulsive and that moved should get vetoed by Silver
Nets need a center too
8-4 since the 2-8 start
For the love of all that's holy, just let them get into a position where we don't draw them in the first round.
We'll be the Heat of the next bubble.
Dont see us getting over the Celtics, Nets, Sixers or Bucks, 5th is best case scenario and 6,7 is probs the expected seed
nah... 6th is what im expecting
Yea or that he’s a dirty player lmao
What the fuck are the Nooklyn Nets
I’d cut him some slack tbh, he’s a rookie coach that’s had to deal with a pretty significant roster change not too long ago while dealing with Kyries shenanigans.
How do you know the games he looked bad weren’t the games where Kyrie was the head coach, or Durant was the head coach?
Let me see, his team just lost its depth for Harden, and suddenly became a really really bad defensive team because of Harden and Kyrie on the floor at the same time.  I don't think coaching can compensate for that lack of defence unless you just try and outscore your opponents.  But if your shots don't fall or you run up against a team with good defence, then you just don't win.  Really they should get rid of Kyrie for a a bunch of role players that can play D.

The Slim Reaper
Covin Durant
Refs got Silver's memo: If they die, they die
This drives me crazy every game. Either Toronto are super aggressive and constantly get a ton of foul calls compared to other teams or there’s something fucky going on.
Just a reminder too, we had 14 FTA when we were constantly attacking the rim.

Brooklyn as expected relied on the 3 ball and they got more FTA. weird huh?
Bron stopper
Kyle
Lowry
Over
Virtually
Everything
De callisse lol
BONJOUR MUTHAFUCKA
Foux du fafa
Jus de frambois
Grab them by the Coronas
He’s staying composed which is huge. When Pascal starts to flail around the game becomes hell for him but he’s making the right reads and not rushing things now and it shows.
Firmer on the ball too. Less Stanley Hudson dribbling.
Stopped chucking 3's and started facing up in the paint instead of the unconfident "back them down from 3 point line, fake one way, spin the other for an off balance shot"
Still he took advantage of the matchups, esp Kyrie
During pre game warm ups, there is video evidence of dez greeting and hugging players on the field. Moments before kick off, the nfl told dez he couldn’t play because he tested positive. But the game went on as if we did not just see dez close contact with everyone without a mask
I still blame GSW medical staff
We just sorta maybe just a little had somewhat of a not positive reaction to that injury /s
demar.
Kd wanted to play.
Fair, but Harden's been like this pretty much since the big three got together. He's only taken 15+ shots twice in the last eight games.
[Watching Toronto shut down a top player while his supporting cast fails to adequately pick up the slack](https://imgur.com/a/yiNgDxE)
Bembry was great in there too
Pocket full of sunshine
You stay in HIS pocket lmao. No escape
Lmfao no. Harden would make vanvleet look like a child, raptors just loaded up on him and he made the right reads
[deleted]
It's because the raptors played really good defense on him lol
Baynes missed at least 6 wide open layups tonight. It’s like the guy has never touched a basketball before. Put me out there for free and I can foul the other center for 3 quarters
smh the NBA should have just came up north to play in Canada. Half joking, it probably would have ended up better than it is currently going and I would 100% buy a Halifax Lakers jersey.
yeah I meant with teams crossing the border
And the way our players were aggressively throwing themselves at him, he was bound to foul out. It still sucks to see him go likes this.
Nah I'm not joking. If he makes one more all star team itll be 7 for his career. Only one player in nba history has had 7 all star appearances and didnt make the hall of fame
And as of now hes got an 85% of making it according to BB Reference
He is by every means, you’ll see.
I can support both
I’m guessing cause they don’t have a James harden flair
this emoji looks hilarious on PC

🧐
Since Harden joined. Not ashamed to say I'm more of a Harden fan than a Nets fan.
I always find it hilarious when I'm watching the ESPN/TNT/ABC streams and the announcers seem genuinely surprised that these all-stars are scoring below their averages against the Raptors.

Maybe if they had some common sense they'd connect the dots and give Toronto's defensive scheme some credit. But naaah. They just call it an anomaly.
It works when you have the depth of the Nets lmao
Story of their fall to the Celtics
Who's that
Maybe don’t run your starters down.
We probs getting 5th or 6th based on the teams current trajectory
Our highest lotto pick is Stanley Johnson. We have no superstars. Give me a break with that.
Is it though? A lot great net highlights came from beating raptors. (Vince game winner, vince game winner, boki game winner, jefferson game winner, pierce block to eliminate raptors, dlo coming out party game)
I mean no disrespect, but it's currently true.
Technically, he’d be the captain selecting the teams, unless they changed the format again
It took 15 episodes to rev him up
I want a Julius Randle vs Pascal Siakam battling in a beyblade arena
Soon enough he will fly like Pegasus
Beyblade: Tournament Edition.
He still has a habit of leaving his feet before he knows what he’s doing. If he can clean that up, he’ll cut down on the TOs even more.
7 turnovers on 5 assists, yikes
Look it’s just following the analytics
Now this is pod racing!
And that'll leave the opponents wiggity washed.
Lol retro jerseys, air force ones and oversized white tees. Plus some roc-a-wear jeans.
It's Gingka from Beyblade, man I would love to see Siakam get one too now.
I’m gonna wear my grills and if you’d like you can ride with me
Fred's defense
ya kyrie looked ... haggard tonight, tired, no looks
I noticed him getting abused on the defensive end lol
We also got burned by that strategy last time we played harden and the rockets. I think McLemore had like close to 30 points cause we just left him open to focus on Harden
If only the Nets had another star other than Harden or KD
succinctly put
but a nets fan told me the other day that Kyrie is so good offensively that it doesn't matter who his defender is he will still get 30ppg on good efficiency
always has been 👩‍🚀🔫
Players are only as good as their most recent games lol
When you put it that way fuck siakam he's trash
The slump was since the bubble last year, and did cost us probably the Finals appearance last year.  We were rolling as #2 seed.  Siakam played like a G leaguer the whole playoffs and we still took Boston to 7.  Not the worst signing, and hopefully he'll shake it off, but it begins with him attacking the rim and not trying to shoot 3's unless he's on the side line and the ball is kicked out to him to shoot.
I'm not sure 2020 counts as "short"
I think fans were justified in their concern.  It was pretty much a calendar year of struggles. Great to see him potentially round the corner though!
*styll
stop OG, you better stop OG!
the other midget
the other midget
Ratpors nephews in shambles lol
Thought you were making a Dune reference at first
All hail muadvleet
Unfortunately you can’t turn off Kyles heart to win  :(
Len actually led the Wizards in scoring tonight with 18 LOL.  Did he even have 18 total for us?
At least
I mean anyone who seriously thought the Raps wouldn't make the playoffs are some braindead haters. Our team is too talented to be missing the playoffs in the East.


We'll be a low seed+a first round exit. But we're definitely making the playoffs.
Yeah it's that "put your head down and push through" mentality that the franchise oozes. I love it.
Yeah we were also dealing with moving into a new city and new arena. Now that we've settled in, and the new guys are comfortable we're slowly working our way back to .500
Everyone is quiet when time proves their ridiculous hot takes wrong
Yeah lol we started cold but we were always going to be able to put something together

People also always seemed to conveniently forget our especially unusual circumstances this year, i.e. the team having to pack up and temporarily move to a new city. Like no shit it was going to take the team a bit to find their footing lol

But if course, on /r/NBA a player or team is only ever as good as their most recent game.
I am down with this. For the sake of competitiveness
[deleted]
6 seed Raps vs. 1 seed Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals. I'm here for it.
fucking bloodbath of a series like the celtics last year
He was referring to the Noronto Naptors, smh.
I think he meant Nick Nurse....

Edit: I’ll just r/woosh myself before anyone else gets the chance...
Where do I get free KD?
FREE ME
"I dont wanna be here"
KoviD
Oh I watched, refs did everything they could to keep Brooklyn in that game. They’re doing the same thing for the Clippers in this game going on rn
FREE ME is the new STOP THE STEAL
Then Dez tweeted out during the game that he’s calling it a year lol
Lmao holy shit
but. but. u just blamed toronto for it...
💯💯

I was so surprised when they put him back out there. Myers presser seemed so sincere... But like, you took a dumb risk with the man knowing he was probably leaving.
Let's not sugarcoat it, there were definitely dumbasses watching their first game ever in the arena cheering for his injury 

I was really bummed out for him when he went down, I remember in the morning when they announced he was playing I just felt weird about him rushing back so quickly, and to see him go down after playing well in the 1st quarter sucked
And it's the job of the teams medical staff to say no when if he isn't ready yet.
Someone has to give up shots lmao. Harden is the best playmaker of the 3 & a good post defender.

He brings that for you guys so i mean, somethings gotta give. I remember a couple years ago he said he hated playing the way he did in Houston
That's because Kyrie frankly won't do it even if he probably should.

Harden is *by far* the best facilitator on the team.  He's looking to get a good shot, regardless of who it is and he will find that guy or shoot it if it's a good shot for him.

Kyrie can bend the defenses the same way, but you IMO Kyrie would rather take a mediocre shot himself than give Jeff Green or Joe Harris a great shot *generally.*
Yeah, but I think it's a good thing for him to be unselfish right now. He can put up points at any time, but feeding his teammates and building up chemistry for the playoffs is a smart move. 

As far as tonight's game goes though, after KD got ruled out I thought he'd be a little more aggressive. Raps were playing him tight but he had a few decent 1 on 1 opportunities he passed up; usually he'd pull a few more stepbacks but I'm not complaining lol
Still too soon eh?  :)  Well we have had plenty of losing to get used to lately, and probably more in the future unless we find a complimentary big, if that makes you feel better.
It feels like too much of an over-correction
Haha you shouldn't have been downvoted for that. He hit a few shots, but missed a tonne too and got abused by DJ on lobs all game.

[removed]
Understandable have a nice day
Who will you root for when he plays against the rockets?
Youd think they wouldve caught on especially since the 2019 playoffs we had so much success with it, (trapping giannis all series, box and 1 on Curry after going up 3-1 and klay going down)
Also to Lebron
So, which is better: your rational, logical perspective or my fucking with a Bucks fan?
I'm just pointing out that harden and the other dude
Had off nights for them
And kd didn't even get a full night

The fact it was competitive says more about how good the nets are than anything about the raptors

I don't particularly care about either team as the team I like is in the West so their results don't particularly matter much
What about the Raptors sweeping the Nets just last year
What about the Raptors going 19-2 over the last 6 seasons vs the Nets?
Oh no, I get it. Just sounds strange haha. Is this where we say good game, or strange game
KD: As captain of the East squad, my first move would be to release Kevin Durant. 

LeBron: LeBron James has been waived.
Even better!
whoever are the captains should just troll and select a bunch of no namers to the teams, since the NBA is a joke anyways for still trying to host an all star game.  might as well give bench guys their time to shine.
Raptors filler arc is now over.
"LET IT RIIIIIP!"
He lost his bitbeast and had to regain it’s trust.
15 episodes of literal screaming back and forth like good old DBZ.
Coming direct to blu-ray May 2021
Turn the jersey around and rock the name on the front. Welcome to 2002.
They only watch me for my pimp juice.
Makes sense, guess that's a true sign of a great defender: if you barely even notice his man on the court
I was kind of wondering too whether he was frustrated with the KD situation, and if that affected his game.
I'm just glad a juggernaut like the Nets don't have a player like McLemore.
I was at this game in person, confused why we were getting cooked by players I'd never heard of.
Was at that game, first and only Raptors game I saw that was a loss.
Don’t be that guy
No dude save that for his next mediocre or bad game lol
You right my bad fam
OG, You say you put me on fashion? Wow
Vanvleet?
I'm lighting one for Cade as we speak
it is
>Unfortunately 

?
He mightve played 18 minutes
He wasn’t much worse than Baynes tbh
Picking late first round ;(
For real. And that's what I love about the culture we've built now. Been like this for a few years now
Turns out the rebuild was just getting Pascal going.

Who knew
Taking emotions out of the equation, any Bucks fan should sign up for that in a heartbeat. But the very thought of it chills me to my soul.
I thought he meant Steve's brother, Neve Nash.
Look here, fella. We take these postgame threads seriously here on r/NBA. WIth this kind of flippant remark, you're about to meet the ban-hammer. Wise up before it's too late.
In the land of the snakes
Is that you KD?
Couldn’t stop Kyle Lowrys greatness though
My logic is as flawed as the NBA Covid protocols. 🤷‍♂️
Was a complete panic move.

Going into the series they thought they could win without him since they just easily swept Portland, but then once they found themselves down 3-1 they knew they didn’t really stand a chance with just Steph, Klay and Dray and got desperate.
Mb, I should have added the /s, we were deservedly getting shit on by this sub after that play, just a real dirty move.
I was actually at the game and was cheering at the fast break bucket. Timeout called and lost in all of it was KD on the ground..... Then we realised. It may have taken 10-15 seconds but definitely didn't look good on Toronto fans
He was ready. Dude got multiple fucking opinions. Shit happens.
Funny that i fully agree with that but am still shocked that it isn't the worst of the 3 giving up the shots instead.
[deleted]
> Yeah, but I think it's a good thing for him to be unselfish right now. He can put up points at any time, but feeding his teammates and building up chemistry for the playoffs is a smart move.

Kyrie absolutely needs to be doing this as well but he seems to have no interest in it.
Lol it'll be too soon for awhile for me. Like as of now, I *should* be confident in the Bucks' ability to beat you guys in a playoff series. But if it actually came to fruition, it would scare me shitless.
Youre delusional if you think hes not making HoF lmao, he might not be 1st ballot but hes definitely making the hall...
You as well. I genuinely think the Harden trade is going to end up being a win win.
Honestly haven’t thought of it. Been watching some of each team’s games although I’ve definitely watched more nets games (they seem to always play close high scoring games lol). In an NBA finals type situation probably Harden to get his ring.
Getting flashbacks of Channing Frye looking like the 2nd coming of Jesus Shuttlesworth
Harden had a off night just like Embid had an off night, Luka had an off night, Giannis had an off night, Tatum had an off night. Give our defense some credit. If you actually watched instead of blithely commented you would know we regularly shut down top guys and live and die by what the rest of the team can do.
Are we talking about the bubble nets? I'm honestly surprised we even made it the playoffs with that line up lol.
Man it's been 6 seasons since fuck brooklyn???? Crazy how quick the nets went from kg/pierce to bottom feeders to kd/kyrie/harden.
Raptors had a good game. Can't say the same for anyone else ( nets, espn, nba and refs) was garbage. The whole production felt off.
Kevin Knox and Anfernee Simons now confirmed All Stars
They could play the all star game only with players that have had covid already!

Whats the best All Covid Team?

Mitchel
Seth Curry
Butler
?
KAT
The Tampa Bayblades have arrived.
Upgraded from Siakam Galaxy to Siakam Galaxy Turbo
Between him and Boucher, the rim mics pick up some pretty comical soundbites.
Nelly's bandaid under the eye though. Can't forget about that.
A nets fan tied my shoelaces together and made me fall down in front of my crush
thats exactly what I said to that Nets fan, some people eh
keep guessing
"FaDe For CaDe!"

"PaScAl is WasHed!"
faded for cade
for them
Thats been a pretty low bar this year.
OG... Siakam... Flynn looking okay. We will find someone in the late first.
And getting rid of Len...
Well KD did grow up a raptors fan...
Nah man, some people were waving goodbye to KD seeing him on the floor.  In the heat of the moment I know why it happened, KD going down hugely improved the Raps chances, and a championship starved city was en route to getting its first ever NBA championship

Still, we were shitty
I’m not, Kyrie is no where near the passer/playmaker that Harden is + Harden has more gravity so it’s better he gives up the shot
Harden had 12 assists tf you on about LOL
Harden is averaging the most assists in the NBA lmfao
A couple more than 10, you mean?
Probably won't happen.  The Raptors are missing serviceable big men, and have a logjam of guards right now to make any type of run.  Losing Ibaka this year was huge mistake for Masai Ujiri and has set us back big time!
Kinda don't like the trade tbh just because its a shame seeing pacers lose their boy
But eh
It’s been a long time since the Nets and Raptors have been competitive.  

From 2013-14 to 2019-20 the Raptors have won the most games in the NBA including 6 of 7 division championships
It's the first time in a very long time that I could say we played great on ESPN. That being said, your last point is correct. KD is my favourite player in the league, so I was really excited for this matchup. It's too bad it kind of went sideways
Marcus Smart!
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Cory Joseph?
Brown is 6’4 so idk how you’re gonna call him a midget
We gonna end up with Princepal Singh to sell out those 905 tix in Brampton.
True. True. 

I think we've uncovered KD's burner
yeah, and he's averaging 12 since he got to BKN. What a weird post.
12 is obviously the new 2
It's really impressively inaccurate.
You are almost certainly right. On paper, there'd be no real reason for us to lose to you guys in a playoff series this year. But if the matchup happened, I'd be terrified. Logic be damned.
Hey, you got a win and got to see kd "play". Glass half full lol
all that height and he'll still never come close to being on lowry or even vanvleets level 😬 TOUGH lmao
He isn’t one, just plays like one
Literally ahahahaha, dude wanna act like its a bad thing Harden has taken a step back but STILL gets the same attention that he used to from our guys.

Miami big 3 bosh took the step back & people understood but now Harden is people don’t get it?
True that. Hope he's back for you guys vs Philly
Lmaoooo talk your shit Raps fans 😂
He’s a role player... nobody expects him to. Do raptors fans get this hyped after every win? Or is it just because your window for contending is fully closed?
BME
The curse of Harden. If he scores 36, he's a ball hog, if play makes, he needs to fight for buckets more. Rocket fans know it well: to many people, Harden literally cannot win.
A win over the Nets is big for any team not just the Raptors. They are averaging 127 pts since Harden joined. Do you even watch games? Sixers are the top of the rankings but Nets are the best team in the east and probably in the league
or are you just salty because our somewhat shell of a team beat your overly stacked team? or was Kyrie and Harden and KDs 19 mins of getting locked up not enough?
Man he played a really solid game today even though he himself wasn’t lighting up the score board himself. Made all the right reads & wasn’t trying to force. How is that not enough for people
Nah not salty it’s one game without our best player for the majority. I just hate the raptors and their shitty fan base
Same exact thing happened somewhat frequently when he was on the Rockets. People would post about Harden disappearing in the 4th or whatever in a game where they started doubling him and he started finding the open man. Harden would have ended up scoring or assisting on 50% of the points in a qtr or something and people would be complaining about him playing passive or choking. 

Made me realize how many people talk about shit without watching the game.
he did play, did you watch the game he got locked up with that fire statline 🔥🔥 8 points 4 fouls 3 Turnovers on 37% fg in 19 minutes🔥🔥 nah but you dont salty at all tho lmao
[Remember when the Nets were up by 15 points and had the lead at halftime](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/icvf2u/z/g2511ix)
OKC really said fuck the tank. I'm impressed
This franchise is incapable of tanking.

Also, New York Diallo is a top 10 player.

Steve Nash just lost to Mark Diagonal
We are the anti tank
4-1 on the 5 game road trip, just like we all expected
Kevin Durant is a Shai phonecall away from returning to the Thunder.
KD played alone tonight
We’re gonna fuck around and make the playoffs again, aren’t we?
God I love this Thunder team so much

COACH MARK FOR COTY
DIALLO FOR MIP
Thunder gonna barely miss the playoffs and get the No 1 pick through good Karma
How do we keep doing this??
We’re actually above .500
OKC are anti-tanks bruh. they just re-tool every fucking year.
Presti needs to step in and get this season under control for OKC.
Man KD just cant win with these cats
What are we doing
If the wizards can’t guard a parked car what can the nets guard?
wasnt the thunder suppose to be bad
Nash probably grabbing his friends and shaking them: "YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS GONNA BE FUCKING EASY!"
#gai4shai
TOO GOOD TO TANK?!
Everyday we stray further from championships.
SGA, Diallo, Horford and Dort looked awesome.
Presti is such a good gm that when he’s unable to tank when getting rid of all his players
S G BAE
This comes down to Nash giving Shamet 16 fucking minutes. Ik it’s early but I’m honestly getting worried about this team
Yes sir SGA is a bad bad boy
Made the right decision switching to this from the Bears/Saints game. Such a fun one
KD should of never left OKC
Fuck it I'm happy Shai 31pts bomb
On the plus side, some of those KD drives were some Giannis 2K nonsense
OKC is so good
Some days it seems like the Nets are just one more elite scorer away from being a contender.  If only they had somebody who fit that bill.
Shamet with a -15 yikes
Fuck the tank, that felt good! SGA already on his way to becoming the second greatest Thunder player
What happened to the tank
why did the nets trade the pick for shamet and not just kennard..
Can't win with these cats v2.0
lmao we’re ass
I did not see the Nets being under .500 at any point this season. Damn.
Yo what if the Thunder fuck around and make the 'yoffs again lmao
FUCK THE TANK
I don't know any of the guys below George Hill's name in the OKC box score lol
OKC is gonna fuck around and make the playoffs while the FO is trying to tank lmao
What a fucking franchise you have OKC! Never backed down from strong decision always contending or trying to do so. But let me tell you i started follow nba when Seattle was raped and OKc born, without Sam Presti u were done. He's the jewel of Pop and R. C. Buford still nowadays, Spurs organization let him go to wish his best for his career and look at what he done! I can't imagine me doing this in MyLeague on 2K, dunno how he make the team competing without stars, changing core since 2 years, while holding picks from half nba. Amazing genius, he's what sam Hinkie shoud have done, besides accolading picks and cutting players without inform their agents. Presti is very confident with his key players. Hope those picks will turn in the next amazing players never seen, all together like 10 years ago, carrying you to the title.
brooklyn players can't even defend their mothers of getting robbed in front of them.

KD is playing incredible coming from an Achilles, Nash needs to understand he has to take DJ, TLC and Shamet out of the rotation.

And play some fucking defense.
As a Nets fan, when should I become worried? I don’t doubt we will get better as the season goes on, but man we should be better than this.
Thunder is definitely making the playoffs at this rate. Fuck the tank
Nets defense is poop
Was Kyrie on PTO?
KD just looks better and better each time out. Sucks that Kyrie is being a little emo baby, otherwise they can finally build some cohesion with the team.
Didn't think the  Nets would have a negative W/L at any point this season, and it comes at the hands of OKC. What is life.
Kyrie the tank commander
5-6 Nets still going to run the East ? 😂😂😂
fuck a tank

fuck bwlktnlyn

fuck KD
KD would be an amazing addition to OKC.
Sometimes KD looks like he is thinking he’s in GS offense while he finds rhythm in nets offense. Lot of out of synch stuff with kd leading to turnovers
OKC might make the playoff again this year
I admit to forgetting what team Horford got traded to but how has he been all season?
8th seed baby!
[MRW I saw the score to this game](https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/105/files/2014/12/lance-stephenson.gif)
defensively the nets are such a mess at the moment
landry shamet needs to not be on the floor. Like ever
Crazy how instead of attacking the rack the nets continued to keep bricking 3s
Hated the Nash hire. Funny people thought Nash would automatically succeed because lue did & Nash was the better higher iq player. You don’t hire coaches without coaching experience. That’s why Kidd’s an assistant & Fisher is in the WNBA. I think he can get better obviously but he should have taken a assistant role somewhere
So the Nets actually suck. Interesting.
It's bad for the tank but its good for the foundation of the team. Kinda bittersweet really lol.
KD should have went back to okc lol
Wait, when did Al Horford end up in Oklahoma City?
You know what?  I’ve had enough of kyrie’s shit. Ban him from all star games.  That lil shit won’t return Nash’s phone calls?  Put a morality clause in for ASG and don’t let kyrie in.
Where are all the preseason threads of “NeTs EAsiLy In ThE FiNaLs”
The only loser in this game is Sam Presti.
OCK loses Westbrook and PG  
OCK: Fuck you

GOD FUCKING DAMMIT
Good to see you again lol, been awhile.
I sometimes try to go all the way back to the beginning. I’ve never made it
Reminded me of PG's game a couple years ago.
How far does this go?

It's back. Finally!!!
King
Fuck
Pain
I missed you so much.
Just pain
Damn I really thought I wouldn’t see this again for a while. 

Pain
Lmao this my favorite thing here, true dedication
I was thinking about this post midway through the 4th. Nets legend
Been some time since I've seen this
Youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!
I did not miss you
hahaha fuck yeah the Nets are back
Lmfaooooo this is great
Most of their picks aren't even theirs so fuck it.
fuck a process
Just let the rest of the league tank for you when you have 1/4 of the draft picks in every draft.
Yea one problem is horford is still kind of untradeable if presti wants an asset
Well they have George Hill, Big Al, and the fact that CP3 somehow managed to rub off his clutchness to SGA, Dort and the other guys that were here last season really puts a wrench on their plan to tank.
Presti is going to trade half these guys for unprotected firsts
Rays kind of vibe
Honestly, what did you expect? Horford and Hill have played winning basketball literally their entire careers which both span over 12-13 years. Shai grew up as a basketballer playing playoff basketball. Same for Dort. OKC have been a winning team. Winning teams can't just tank overnight.
Man loves coming home

Nash does not look good and that pains me to say.
I don’t know if I’m ready for the “white privilege” takes for Nash to gain steam again if this team keeps struggling.
Got crossed up
OKC could really just fuck around and make the playoffs again, and it doesn't even matter because you already have everyone's picks. Genius.
What you doin!! Don't you want to pair Shai with Cade? 


For real though. You guys are admirable. Big kudos.
What the fuck
It's like the Thunder are just incapable of being a flat-out bad team.
My next chapter: my first chapter
ALL IS FORGIVEN IF YOU WIN A SHIP WITH SHAI

jk

unless.....
Would KD be okay with backing up Poku?
KD would actually be dirty on this team with another year of development for Shai, Bazely and Dort.
Lmfao 18 Cavs vibes
That's his style.

He can't play with these cats
I thought Levert played really well.
Nets depth memes were just memes?  Still, gotta be missing Kyrie.
But I thought levert is an all star level guy worthy of trading for James harden???!!!
Where is Kyrie?
yes
Please tho
From your lips to God's ears
Ball Movement Baby
And you know what? KD, Russ and Harden all below 50%
Their ability to retool to field a competitive team, while aquiring draft assets, while ALSO somehow developing young talent (sga and dort last year, bazley and diallo this year) fries my mind.
Presti is a warlock. There's some blood pact he's made because the way he turns lemons into gold mines is just mind blowing.
Dudes looking at Miami and Houston like “maybe we won’t need to tank this year hmm”
Well Hill is definitely getting traded at the least.
We get the best two picks out of us, Houston and Miami. So looking like sabotage time right now.
Soft like charmin
is his legacy overrated cause he cant carry?
Dorting on these hoes
A bicycle with training wheels
A trash can
We’re coming for you next 😎
Too good to DORT?!?
Bazley played about as good of defense as you can on KD, KD still got his, but Baze was always contesting.
The one and only bae.
Y’all traded the 19th pick and a 2nd for him. I doubt he’s gonna sit on the pine.
Yeah def was his most explosive game of the season when it came to attacking the rim
I’m thinking like a crafty ball handler with a shot, no chance of that just walking in the door though
Second after Dort, right?
Fuck the tank, WE DORT!
And none of us saw okc over .500. How the turns table.
I wouldn't be mad.  There has to be some attractive intangible value in a franchise that can make it to the playoffs in the west with this team LMAO.
what did u just say
When did we start calling it the 'yoffs? That's not it lmao
I'm just gonna upvote u simply because u referred to the playoffs as the "yoffs"
A lil 'yoffs ferda boys.
diallo was the dunk contest champion if that means anything
You haven't heard about DORT? Are you sure you like basketball?
Thanks...
This was a classic KD game,  barely even noticed him until the 4th quarter and he already had 20 something points
[OKC to both new york teams](https://i.redd.it/i2uiws0kula61.jpg)
TBF losing Dinwiddie was a HUGE factor, more so than I think a lot of people will give him credit for.
No. The East runs through them.
nice over-reaction, their 2 point guards are out, that tends to make teams look bad
Nah, okc is just the best team in the league.
Nah we just violated both of em
Losing Dinwiddie was huge. As good of a PG as Kyrie is, Dinwiddie was by far our best facilitator and unbelievably clutch. I honestly think he could have been an all star this year, but our team is fucking cursed and can't go a single season without a major injury.
We will be fine
No joke, if Dinwiddie hadn't torn his ACL 3 games in, we'd probably be like 8-3 right now.
I love you for doing this
Thank you, doing gods work son
[deleted]
That was an amazing performance I'm so glad I watched that one, like 25 in the fourth
[5 years](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3qx9sw/post_game_thread_the_spurs_11_defeat_the_nets_02/cwj4fr3/)
Not far enough
Most of them are protected though
Soon, you are going to trust it and you will like it
Still a long season a head of us, Horford will return us a 1st
Barely watched the nets at all. Any particular coaching/lineup errors you're seeing?
That would also be hella attractive for young players on expiring contracts
By beating everyone and being ahed they just making their traded picks better . Win-win
UNLEASH POSTSEASON LU DORT
Hopefully the heat and rockets can come through for us
Otherwise known as the Celtics strategy
I don't think they're nearly bad enough to fade4cade
Well yall helping us get Cade by beating Houston tonight lol
We're the Kings of the Road now. Scania can fuck off with that slogan.
The last time they were bad they got to draft James Harden lol. That’s how long it’s been
The actual hardest road
KD buys an expansion team to play in Seattle again
Starting over.
OKC 2: thunderous boogaloo
Ha thats what LeBron said leaving Heat
Full circle, just like a basketball
The Ouroboros
.........nahhhhh
you could say KD would be dirty on just about any team...
Not even. Bron had a g league team, the Nets are hella deep.
Only on the first half.  Got shut down 2nd.
Sucked ass in the third
They really needed Dinwiddie starting so Caris could lead the bench unit.
Dinwiddie was a key piece for that. He was almost an all star and we need him without kyrie. It'd be like if the lakers were down Anthony davis and Dennis schroeder
Sam Presti is a wizard
Lmao
I hope we keep both Horford and Hill at least through the end of the season. You see Hill actively coaching Shai alot during the games, I think that mentorship is invaluable. Horford also allows these guys to play within a system, and we don't really have a good replacement for his skillset on the roster; Muscala has been pretty good off the bench, but nowhere near the same two-way player.
Nets should trade for him tbh.
He tried to at the end but we could not miss.
He carried in 2014 but it will still be hurt fs. It's more about the team playing like dogshit when he leaves. His playmaking has been great for us.
He’s carried before, but he’s older and coming off what is usually a career ending injury. It’s one thing to lose your second best, but losing him randomly because his chakra was unaligned or something, and having another one of your best players tear is his ACL, idk who besides maybe lebron can carry in that circumstance.
What legacy...?
oh were playing yall next
That block on KD in the 4th on that 3 pont attempt was pretty slick.
By far
Of course, back to back MVPs in 2022 and 2023
You're right about that. The young guys are really ballin' rn!
I mean Shai is clearly a future star. Dort and Bazley are still raw but I’m pretty confident both of them will be legitimate starters in a year or two. And you have so many picks that you don’t even need to fully tank.

I think you are in one of the best situations in the NBA going forward.
I wouldn’t be mad because I’d win $2500 lol
The ‘yoffs
I'm just having fun with it brother
Sounds ugly.
I think it is though.
Tbh I think I'm sold on the phrase
dort was above hill lol
over them
the thunder are trying to lose
No offense to the thunder but it’s the thunder. They have enough talent
Nah I didn't count them lol. 

I opened every comment in it's own individual tab and then used Chrome's "Bookmark all tabs" feature to put them in a folder.

After that, when I clicked to open all the bookmarks at once in this new folder, Chrome gives a warning of "Do you want to open x amount of tabs?" and x was 55 in this case.
Yeah it was insane to watch. There's a reason PG had a mvp campaign that year. I always wonder what would of happened if he did not get injured and kept it up.
A enough of them are swaps though
okc already did the process with kd, russ, harden and ibaka.

they even called it the process.

hinkie is completely unoriginal.
Yea if you take back a truly terrible contract which I have a hard time thinking of.  I don’t think teams aren’t trading a first and expiring a for a guy at his age who’ll put up like 12/7/4 with more than a year left.
Abysmal effort. They are 4-0 vs teams at or above .500 while being 1-6 vs teams with a losing record. It's down to coaching. Also, Nash hasn't been great with his rotations.
No adjustments the thunder made runs at one point in the second quarter the nets went 5 minutes without a point and they kept chucking up 3s, you have Jordan, and KD attack the rim
Presti playing 10D backgammon.
Key difference with the Celtics is they didn't have any established young players. SGA is clearly going to be a stud, and Dort, Diallo and Bazely all have a ton of promise.
If they miss the playoffs they could still somehow win the lottery. It would just be a lot less likely
If the Houston pick is better than ours is it still protected?
The real bad one was the first year of KD... that was a long season to say the least.
Lol idk how we can watch all these Nets games and still claim their deep. None of their guys play defense and they are all inconsistent asf. lol
Hill is on an expiring contract, so he’s definitely getting moved before the deadline.
Yea with all their picks I don't think establishing a winning culture with this squad would be a bad thing at all
the front office is, the players and coaches aren't
work smarter, not harder
Swaps are a reason to be good. You dont get value from a swap if you are worse than the opposition
Indeed
You never know when someone gets hurt/wants out/whatever and they need someone like Horford to make the push/keep in contention.

Even if we don't get a a first for Horford directly, we could get someone who gets us a 1st.
(X) doubt
He's definitely given a pass regarding rotations. The man got handed a deep team in a weird year and most of the players having to play roles they aren't used to. However, he definitely needs to assert himself more for the team to show more effort, you're right on that. He's Steve fucking Nash. They should all just shut up and listen whenever he talks.
LIGHTYEARS AHEAD
Dont forget Maledon!
Nope. It just can’t be top 4.
PJ Carlesimo playing him at the 2 lmao
They made the playoffs last year with half a kyrie for 30 games
True but without KD and Kyrie they still could get a tenth seed unlike that Cavs roster without Bron
They are deep when we win and a bunch of nobodies when we lose. I think they just have some pretty good players off the bench and then a lot of replacement level players that sometimes shine.
Might turn into another Gallo situation where expiring actually hurts us as teams don’t wanna spend assets for someone they probably aren’t gonna pay. The bright side is Hill probably won’t be commanding a large deal so maybe someone goes for keeping him for multiple years but I’m still doubtful
Hill is on contract for 2021-2022.  It's partially guaranteed, but he's still on contract.  We can still trade him in the offseason, guarantee the contract, and receive something back
I’m starting to lead towards a winning culture being one of the most important things for a small market team. You have to be an attractive location for players and Oklahoma sure as fuck isn’t unless you want to build a castle for cheap.
Smarter work, harder not
Unless you have swaps with multiple teams. They’re all exchangeable.
Bryant just got injured just saying.
Wouldn’t Horford to Toronto make a lot of sense?
Well that’s more likely but likely involves sending an asset then which I doubt presti does.  Nothing is certain but I think it’s more likely than not horford doesn’t get great value
They are not performing like that team though ...
They literally made the playoffs last season
Oh wow, not sure why I thought he was expiring. That’s great news because it’s a decent contract with even more value than I initially thought.
I think that's the biggest reason why you see Indiana fight tooth and nail to stay a decently seeded playoff team when a lot of other teams would say "fuck it, let's blow it up". It's so hard to get that winning culture built again once you let it go, and as we've seen with a lot of teams, even amassing great players isn't enough on its own to get it back.
Not only that but I've always believed having your young guys in a winning culture helps with development. They learn what it takes to win, and if you're in a position like OKC is right now where you're gonna add alot of talent regardless of where your own pick is it could be the perfect situation to be winning games with a roster thats perceived to be lacking talent.

Plenty of great players have developed on losing teams, but it definitely helps a players development to be playing in meaningful games and especially to be playing in playoff games early on
You saying the hiking in the Wichita Mountains doesn't cut it as making Oklahoma an attractive location? Say it ain't so
Horford and George Hill for Russ. OKC gets their franchise star back. Wizards now have some defense at the 1 and 5 spots to go with Beal, Rui and Deni. Maybe add pick somewhere to balance it out. OKC has so many other teams picks they can afford to tank less aggressively to maintain a positive culture and have a watchable product.
The east got better this season, I'm basing off of this season's performance.
Shai is showing flashes of what he learned from CP3 last season. His incredible vision and IQ on the guard spot is too damn good.
Glorified hills honestly.
I mean... I like the games are good right now, obviously it isn't Russ backpacking us into the playoffs. Or CP3 fusion dancing the team into the playoffs.

But it is fun
They should be given the benefit of the doubt
Playoffs are definitely gonna be interesting this year. Can KD, Kyrie, and Harden counter the fact that we literally can’t defend against any team in the NBA? Wild ride incoming.
Norvel Pelle may get shat on for this game but he is pretty good at what he does. He can reject any guard's fancy layout and change how players take their shots.

Problem is, as we saw tonight, if he's given anything more than 10 minutes, he's a liability. Fouls way too much, and brings nothing on offense. He's good in small spurts when you need some rim protection on D, but if the Nets plan on having him be their secondary center behind Jordan.. good luck lol.

Anyway go Sixers. Embiid is a monster, Simmons is underrated.
1. Nets pulled their starters WAAAYYY too early. A 13 point game with 4 minutes left is plenty of time and we've given up more in less time.

2. As soon as Doc made the move to put Ben Simmons on Harden, this game went from tied to a 20+ point lead. 

Ben Simmons good.

Edit: While I have your attention, maybe you guys should stop removing the Ben dunk highlights. Or at least let us know the reason as to why they were removed
Lol Norvel still can’t play literally any meaningful minutes without fouling out. Dude is hilarious tho, happy he’s getting a shot. 

Exciting game. What a mess from refs. None of the techs given tonight on either team were deserved
Mods, stop deleting Ben’s dunk. This is seriously so stupid.
Some covid losses and some covid wins.
Ben Simmons is the most poorly reffed best player in the league
Joel Hans Embiid
Embiid still hasn't scored below 30 in a while.
Every time the Sixers play:

"The Philadelphia 76ers (Defeat/Fall To) the (Insert Team Here) Behind Joel Embiid's 3X points"
The Nets decision to just give up is almost as confusing as Docs decision to put Ben and Joel back in in a blow out
[removed]
Glad to see Seth somewhat back to his old self this game.
Clap your hands everybody
Didnt even look interested all night n embiid had 33, n im a homer ik its just so effortless for him.
7 6ers scored in double figures.
I wish both teams could have been healthy but I guess this is what the 2021 season is going to be like.
These refs sucked ass
Embiid rolling out of bed for 30+ everyday lately
Yeah Philly you won but just wait until Jason Kidd and Vince Carter is backk
The box score is waayyy off. 73 to 70 and the Sixers won?
You cannot convince me the sixers aren't the best team in the east (for now)
Turns out it hards to beat the best player in the NBA when you don’t have a guy who can try to guard him
that third quarter was a lot of fun. glad we took care of business this time vs a hobbled opponent
And simmons got a tech for dunking too hard
how the hell is joe harris only getting 21 minutes
Wasn’t expecting a win but it was nice for us to stay relatively competitive with Philly for that game
Did Nash just give after the 3rd quarter?
tyler johnson looks like mini robin lopez with that much hair.
So I guess this settles it 

Levert + Allen > Harden
It still scares me to think what Harden/Embiid woulda looked like.
MVPIID
Nash isn’t gonna be coach next season if he can’t get this team to at least the conference finals. Shouldn’t have hired a rookie coach..
[deleted]
The Nets situation can't be fixed
Losing Durant makes our defense a lot worse.
You have so many shooters. I’d trade Harris and Spencer and see what you can get.
I think they'll struggle against length and athleticism which will take away their normal shooting rhythm  and obviously run that ball in transition against their sleepwalking defense (transition is where bad defensive teams break down and collapse, (most people can defend half court if the game was always dead after each ball)
How many games have KD, Irving, and Durant even played together this season?

KD is a really good defender, especially in the playoffs when he doesn't have to manage his effort, and Harden isn't bad either when he's trying on D.

I don't know what to think of the Nets yet, at all. Need to see way more games where the big 3 actually play together.
Nets need defense and the Sixers need more scoring. Ben Simmons and Thybulle for James Harden is the answer. 

Ben playing center for the Nets would be amazing. Imagine Ben at center vs Joel in the ECF.
[deleted]
Hopefully nic claxton fills in the 2nd center spot over pelle soon
Yeah he's pretty much as advertised. Got a block and two fouls in 2 minutes of play.
Pelle is a fun player, but he was a big negative for us last year. Part of that is lineups with no spacing, but he’s not a helpful player at this point
Seems like the first half was testing out how good Green would be on Harden because Simmons would have to guard KD, and Green looked uhhh okay.
That is a trend in our games. The late simmons switch.
Because they hate the Process
Ben take it personal to show he's more valuable than Harden
Embiid for MVP!!!
Simmons is one of the best and most flexible defenders in the league. Probably one of the few who can defend most 1-5s along with Bam and prime Draymond--I assume he'd struggle against the best 5s (embiid, jokic) and the best 1s (dame, curry), but thats only a handful of players he may not shut down out of the entire league.
Meh IDK... rules about complaining about calls and taunting are pretty clear for all players. Just don't do it. All part of cleaning up the game, not saying I agree with it, but its pretty clear and wll kkown
I think the nba refs may be the r/nba mods
Celtics mods at it again
Rona give and rona taketh away
Meaning he gets fouled all the time?
He doesn’t sell fouls. Ever.
That’s a homer take lol. It’s easily Steph Curry and not even close.
Joel African Lion Embiid
Someone on Twitter said he rolls out of bed and scores 30 and at this point there’s they’re completely right.
And other than Sixers fans no one seems to give a shit haha.
Okay .... you can say that about Steph curry or harden or dame
I'm fine with the Ben decision. Gotta get some practice with him at the 5. 

Don't understand Embiid.
Not sure why people think it's that baffling? 2 starters out, DJ got hurt, and lot of minutes for Harden and Harris the night before. A lot of outside factors on this.
Second night of a back to back away. Down double digits in the 4th.

Also, throw our bench guys who haven't seen any solid playing time all season into the fucking ringer lol.
harden has played insane minutes and so has joe harris. This game means absolutely nothing for us. We're a top heavy roster that just needs to be healthy for the playoffs while getting chemistry along the way. It was a smart decision, one injury to harden or harris and we're fucked.
a weird number of sixers highlights get deleted while every bad simmons take stays up
Probably celtic mods
Mods are weird
They don't wanna see Ben win.
We will not be silenced
Seth getting back to where he was would be huge
Bricking 3s left and right 😭 that's gonna hurt his percentage
Yup, it is what it is for now. Playoff matchup with both teams at full strength would be mint.
Jesus sixers fans are the biggest homers in the league
he's playing 32 minutes a game this season dude
Kinda surprised seeing him top 12 in minutes played, didn't seem like hes out there that much.
We were gassed from a back 2 back. I don’t think he wanted to risk an injury from over working our starters. Especially with the refs doing whatever the refs were doing. Wasn’t worth the fight.
I legit thought he was Lopez when I first saw him tooling around the bench.
Lol. If I’m remembering correctly you guys were on the second night of a back 2 back when we played you last.
bruh complaining about losing a game without 2 of your 3 good players, on the road, in a back to back, against the best home team in the nba, talk about next level entitlement

Just be happy that you got it competitive until midway through the 3rd
If Nash gets fired Dantoni can probably take over.
Nothing. Nets just decided to lose for some reason
Post Achilles tear Durant is your best defender, I'd wince every time he has to defend the rim
Dinwiddie’s got no value, he’s out for the year and can be a free agent in the offseason

I do think they should trade for Nerlens Noel though, would give their defense a significant bump and he shouldn’t be hard to acquire
Harris for Thybulle who say no?
Yup, blocks and fouls
A typical game for him in Philly was 1:45 of playtime at the end of a game that wasn't close
Yup. Textbook Pelle. He’ll give you 2 or 3 really impressive blocks and 3 or 4 bad fouls in 10 minutes with no offense.
He made some of the highlight blocks that he's known for tonight, but he once again was a 0 factor on offense. Also note that while he was with us, our centers were Embiid and Horford, and even Kyle O'Quinn, so he was used just sparingly for us when Embiid was resting and we needed some defense.

He played 17 minutes for you guys tonight, and with that much time played, his weaknesses get severely exposed. If he has to play 15+ mins for you guys against teams with strong centers, good luck to you lol.
Yes, down to pretty much every detail. Our broadcast didn't pan to him on the sideline to view his celebrations though so can't comment on that aspect of his game
Highlight blocks, dumb fouls, and zero offensive impact are what you should always expect from Pelle
kinda the high end of games for Pelle lol

awesome dude, but when he’s not putting up 3 blocks in 20 minutes he’s an even bigger hindrance
Yeah this is pretty typical play but usually you get smaller sample sizes. That means that he can either fuck you up for a few mins and foul several times, or he can very competently protect the rim and shut down easy buckets. 

That being said he will fit very nicely with kd kryrie and harden because he doesn’t really want the ball. I think hes a good fit but just dont expect some crazy versatile player. He knows his role
A rotation of Green and Thybull should be good enough for James. The problem is who the fucks guards Kyrie
he is such a liability in the half court that he needs to bring that defensive impact. Also it wasnt a one man effort on harden in the second half. he was being trapped every screen and had no outlets with no other ball handlers on the floor. needless to say the games is plenty different with the rest of the gang. 

Obviously your comment is a joke
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0&ab\_channel=UrielMatt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0&ab_channel=UrielMatt)
Yea but those Harden and Simmons techs were soft as dog shit
The harden tech was bad. The DJ and simmons oens i understand they were being a little outrageous. But harden legit just looked off the ref that should've been a delay of game not a tech.
This explains everything
we are truly oppressed
Meaning things that are called fouls when committed against other players are not called fouls when committed against him
Heard from Australians that it’s an Aussie thing
Agreed.  I’m shocked this hasn’t been fixed since it’s been happening for years
legit lmao, like huh seriously have we forgotten about the greatest shooter of all time versus Ben Simmons? lol
Joel Of course I have the biggest dick I'm the n-word Embiid
Reminds me of Jah getting 20/10 rolling out of bed. And he’s only 19
We're kinda used to it at this point. Half the games we go "Wait Joel got 30? It didn't even feel like he was trying today"
I'm making fun of the fact that literally every PGT for the Sixers includes "behind 30+ points from Embiid"

It's not even a noteworthy occurrence anymore.
Celtics mods
They literally deleted my comment
The mods in here hate us
if he didnt take any threes he woulda gone like 10-12 lol

I fucking wished the nets sub had this mentality. I mean I get why they don't but still.. well be in the playoffs, relax peeps
It’s more than just this one game.. he’s made questionable decisions the whole season.
I already wince every time he falls down.
have you watched him? Hes holding opponents to 37% dfg. He completely shut down tatum in the christmas day matchup and did well on kawhi in the second half. People give dont give him credit because he was on golden state but he played great defense on lebron too in the finals against him twice and actually guarded him unlike lebron who ducked the matchup. He has been good defensively for us its just we start 4 other bad to terrible defenders in harris, kyrie, dj, and harden.
Dinwiddie has some value because if you trade for him you get his bird rights
Eh I watch a bunch of Knicks games and Noel is just a Pelle who fouls harder...
Sixers.  Cause Tisse is cheaper and younger
I do. Tisse is way too good of a defender.
no. but you can take Shamet and TLC back for free
Damn, I thought it was first game nerves lol. Oh well....
And 4 fouls in that time
I think he becomes the 3rd string C once Nic Claxton is healthy. And then he’ll probably get waived once we can find a good big in the buyout market lol
Green will guard Kyrie

We're gonna sign Corey Brewer to guard Harden
It’s going to have to be Tobias.
Doesn’t matter. They just need to slow the nets down. Given their complete lack of defense, that should be enough for the team to pull out a win.
After the game Doc said it was deliberate to see how long we can go guarding Harden traditionally without Ben, to give Ben an energy advantage when he did eventually have to guard him






Curry's gonna have to guard Kyrie, he has sneaky fast hands, but to be honest he's gonna have to hope Kyrie is just off more than rely on his defensive prowess.

Ehh, Thybulle shouldn't get any meaningful minutes in a series because he can't shoot the 3, so you can't have him out there or it'll fuck up the spacing too much.

Harden was eating Green alive I thought, we spammed Embiid in the pick and roll and Green couldn't get past the screen so either DJ got a dunk or Harden shot his stupid looking floater over Embiid.

I fully acknowledge and expect Embiid to drop at least 35 on the Nets in a series every game, but man he's gonna be the main offensive focal point as well as getting pick and rolled to death by a trio of Kyrie, KD, and Harden. Hell this game Joe Harris was attacking him in the pick and roll and it led to wide open mid rangers because while Embiid is one of the best rim protecters in the game, he's not great on the perimeter.
Thybulle is a decent defender but he's far from being acceptable on Harden. 

1. He fouls too much

2. Harden's too big

It's not really an acceptable matchup.
Man the Simmons tech was pretty deserved lmao. He screamed in Meth Curry’s face and followed him. It’s all good but still.
Sixers fans are the most oppressed people after gamers
Gotcha. Yes. I agree haha.
Its curry by far
Yeah it really is. I guess it goes along with that fighter type mentality that australians take into things. Its why you also see players like baynes repeatedly get dunked on because he will fight for everything. As an Australian there's nothing embarrassing about getting dunked on if you put up a fight but you'd be seen as a primadonna if you avoid it to save face. Playing and sucking up the rough treatment is kinda the same thing.
He grew up watching and playing Aussie Rules. Watch some 90's highlights of that and you'll see. Maybe not these days as they're weak as piss, but back in the day hard as rocks.
doesn’t have a lot to do with shooting ability but i agree its curry... and then ben
Joel "Pride of Yaoundé" Embiid
Remember when he was scoring 30 by just being excited as hell? Now look at this dude haha.
Agreed he’s our guy he should be doing that . The fact that Tobi is stepping up this season is great . Unfortunately overshadowed by embiid
Celtics mod delete the shit out of that comment lol
Yea I mean that’s usually what inexperienced head coaches do. Let him learn.
I think you're missing the point of what was said. No one was saying he isn't a good defender, it's the fact you're asking a post severe injury KD to be your best defender is not a good position to be in 

Also bringing up the warriors/Cavs finals isn't exactly a strong example, given that KD could literally just decide when to switch on offensively and defensively because of how good that team was, while if LeBron didn't play 46 minutes and be locked in offensively the Cavs basically didn't operate. Swap LBJ and KD and it would be the exact same story.
Yeah not only did lebron have to average 35 point triple double for the games to be somewhat competitive he should've guarded their opponents best player. What the hell does the rest of cavs do? Might as well play 1v5 at that point
very true, that could make a difference to the right team
I totally hear that comparison but I can’t totally agree with it, I really think Noel is a serious tier above Pelle as a defender.

Noel’s second in the league in deflection rate iirc, he’s only picking up 3.7 fouls per 36 too which isn’t that bad, and it’s a noticeable notch better than previous years. His DBPM this year is 3.8, which is ridiculous, and it’s not an outlier compared to previous years. I don’t think he’s a guy that can play 35 minutes, but he’s year after year been a seriously impactful defender in his minutes, and Pelle’s just not at that level, he wasn’t even really playable for the Sixers last year.
This is a joke right, I’m almost afraid to ask
Delusional
You are delusional
He might not be but most Sixers fans would do that deal in a heart beat lol
Shamet played well tonight.
Turns out shamet can only shoot in the wells fargo center
I'd take Shamet back.
There are worse options but yeah he's not really a full time backup center.
Yeah that is what you’re going to get from Pelle.  He isn’t young either so I wouldn’t expect much improvement on offense.   He is fun to watch though and goes for every block
And 3 blocks
Oh they are in BIG trouble now
Please let this happen lol
🅱️rewer
We'll let you borrow dort for the playoffs
I’m almost tempted to put Tobias on KD. KD’s amazing but Tobias is a good defender, and KD isn’t blazing past people this year, he’s just an unreal shooter. He’s gonna get his, I’d rather Ben on Harden who he can more seriously affect than I think he will KD.
If he dies he dies


Tobias guards stronger 4s better than quicker ones.  He should be on Durant.  Simmons on Harden.
Jo is actually super effective showing/switching on PnR. The problem, as you state, is that it wears him down. He's the only player (I can think of) that carries so much of the load both offensively and defensively. And he has (finally) learned to pick his spots. So, the pattern this year has been: drop on PnR and protect the rim/try to break up the lob for quarters 1-3; then for the last 6 minutes of the game, go nuts, flash, switch, attack the PnR. He is capable of being very disruptive.  And he's shockingly switchable. He'll give up the jumper if he's iso'ed on the wing. And he does get beat off the dribble. But his recovery speed and timing often result in the chase down block.

All this is to say, Jo plays possum against the PnR for three quarters because they need him to score 30 every night. But when it counts, he can fuck shit up.
So you stick Thybulle on Kyrie, with some DG, some DG on Harden with (limited) Tobias, and you stick Ben on KD?
he had at least one block and one steal on Harden tonight
Yes he got a bit hype after almost getting cut off for the dunk. But a tech tho?
GAMERS THEY LITERALLY TARGETED GAMERS
Are we the most oppressed fanbase though? In terns of Dave Silver actively fucking us, like the Kings are just dumb.
Leigh Matthews breaking that behind post is top tier sports highlight. Every sports fan should watch it. 


Should be somewhere in here.
https://youtu.be/vJ0stAfKPlQ
That Cavs team functioned well because it was built really dang well to get everything they could out of LeBron.

The flaw with that is that it means they had absolutely no team identity when LeBron sits.

Losing Kyrie didn't really weaken them, it just made the flaw of the team build more glaring. They still made the finals.

If they'd built a more well rounded team, I think they would have given the Warriors more problems - the years KD was here, the Warriors were not deep.
That's not the point he said I'd wince every time he defends the rim. Durant has been a great rim protector for years. Also yeah it's not ideal that Durant is our best defensive player but he is good
He didnt guard him in 2012 either so this is a mute point.
Cleveland for one of their bigs. They could use a backup guard
I mean I'm just speaking from the eye test, so if the stats say that I'll take your word for it.

All I know is that Noel, who is in his prime as a rim-running center, only got a minimum deal from the Knicks. He has butter fingers and dubious finishing abilities. For all of DJ's faults he is still supremely efficient around the rim and he will finish off alley-oops.

Also, in the playoffs Jeff Green will probably play 35 minutes a game. We are a small ball team through and through, and we only need a solid big guy when we play you guys. And it really seemed like DJ didn't do that bad a job. I expected Joel to bulldoze his way to the rim and dominate under the basket, but he pretty much exclusively took jumpers, and I don't think Noel or any other guy really, can impede those.

I'd rather trade 2 second round picks (I think we have like 6 tradable 2nds) for McGee.
How?  The money saved on getting Harris can be used to get a stretch 4 or another ball handler which is more important right now
He's OK in losses sometimes, and is usually terrible any other time.
[deleted]
And a couple air guitars. Great frostsy freeze out guy too.
🅱️ig trou🅱️le
Funnest game ever
KD would just shoot over him though. I think Ben has a better chance to contain KD. Hopefully we’ll have a chance to see before the playoffs begin. Doc said himself he’s still working on rotations and adjustments.
Put Embiid on KD then, lol
Thybulle looked alright, he just need to stop fuckin reaching on every player he defends.
Sacrifices must be made
Lmaooo
Who cares if Durant gets his.  He takes the shot the sixers wanna force anyway, let Durant get his shut down the rest of the offense
> He's the only player (I can think of) that carries so much of the load both offensively and defensively

Giannis maybe?

> So, the pattern this year has been: drop on PnR and protect the rim/try to break up the lob for quarters 1-3; then for the last 6 minutes of the game, go nuts, flash, switch, attack the PnR. 

Hey, so Embiid's defensive approach is identical to the Nets defense! Only try hard for the last 6 minutes of the game! Except Embiid has the natural defensive prowess to still be really solid the rest of the game, and the Nets don't really possess that kind of personnel. Although I did see a stat that the Nets closing line up (fully healthy) has a ridiculously good defensive rating, but it was a tiny sample size.

> He'll give up the jumper if he's iso'ed on the wing

And that's where I think the Nets will have a shot. I don't know which one of our teams will win in a series, but honestly betting on Harden/Kyrie/KD with a sprinkling of Harris and Green to make jump shots over the course of a series seems like a pretty solid bet.
Honestly, unless the Nets get some defense, I think "good enough" will end up being plenty for the really good teams against the Nets.
Defence isn't just blocks and steals. To slow down Harden you need to be able to defend with your body and defend without fouling. 

Matisse is very handsy and he still fouls quite a bit. 

Also, not that it matters too much but he had 1 block on Harden (on an admittedly very good defensive play), but zero steals.
That’s a clear tech. I was laughing my ass off but  I said he totally deserved it.
He was shoved by him going for a lay up on the previous play. Was hard to catch in real time.
What the fuck even is that sport
Again it was nothing to do with his actual ability, but the continued wear and tear on a serious injury and the additional stress that might cause it to reoccur. You dont want KD having to defend around the rim and be going vertical to challenge at the rim.
He’s wincing because he’s afraid KD is gonna get hurt defending the rim, not because he doesn’t think KD is capable of defending down low. He just shouldn’t have to, especially at this point in his career.
Jarrett Allen would do well on the Nets
This isnt remotely how it works. They're already in the tax they could acquire Harris by sending out enough money but its not like you can just take his salary and say "Now we have this much money to spend on free agency"
And he's an all NBA bench cheerleader
Yeah, I’m excited to see it regardless. I’m curious what Ben’s defense on KD looks like, he’ll be great, but how much it affects his shots and deters him will be interesting.
But he provides almost no offense. Love him to death and he’s hands down the cutest player in the nba, but his offense is pretty limited.
You and me both. Loved that whole sequence from Benjamin.
I was thinking Drummond lol
Good to hear. I could tell he had great energy and personality from watching his intro interview. Plus we could do with a good bench hypeman lol
Hol up
I was honestly sad to see him leave. Good vibes and positivity. Then he check in and picked up 5 blocks and 5 fouls in 5 minutes. We all loved Pelle in philly. Dont think you'll find many sixers fans (except the extreme douches) that didn't love him
I’ll fight you on whomever you think is cuter than Matisse.
He must be like Theo Pinson for us. I don’t think you could ask for a better bench hypeman with all his dancing and reactions. It was an absolute punish having to watch him on the court though lol. Still sad he’s not on the team anymore, and it’s even weirder that he’s on the Knicks now.
Cutest squad in the association with Thybulle Ben and Maxey, @ me
Tired of watching Junior Varsity games, but I do enjoy how scrappy our bench team is on defense. Nash really blew it not putting Allen in earlier down the stretch. JV leaving hurt us.
Waste of a phenomenal LeVert game. Jordan playing over Allen until 1 min left in the 4th is a travesty, what was Nash thinking?
Excuse me, Caris got 43 on HOW MANY shots??? Sheesh!
43 on 23 shots is crazy
Don't let the final score fool you. We choked a 22 pt lead. Brooks kept getting into foul troubles. Two flagrant 1s and a tech. Jonas had to leave. Some of Clarke's shots kept rimming in-and-out. We even choked a 7 pt lead down the 4th with 7 mins to go. But, we kept grinding it out and went clutch mode within the final 3 mins or so. Jenkins made the right rotations tonight.

Caris LeVert was hot today. No Brooks or Jonas to guard him. Kept making 3s like it's nothing. 

Seriously, we need healthy Ja and Jaren vs healthy KD and Kyrie.

GG Nets.
Nets: Manhandle the 7-1 Sixers

Also Nets: Lose to a depleted 2-6 Grizzlies team despite Caris Levert dropping 43 points
Caris is legit.. shame we couldnt get the W
EXCUSE ME!?

Caris LeVert scored how much on *checks notes* 15 for 23!?? Holy shit!
wtf was Nash even doing
Good shit Memphis
I don't hate any of our players
But when I see Shamet and DJ on the court together I wanna throw the fuck up
Memphis playing against the Bubble Nets is the best team in the league, change my mind
Undefeated when Tim Frazier plays
Jordan in the game instead of Allen during close out makes no sense. Especially during the timeout with 3:30 to go and not making the substitution.
Can we just play the nets without kd and kyrie the rest of the year?
Let this game serve as a reminder how much more impressive 40 point games are when they aren’t accompanied by 10+ missed FGs and 20+ fts
Put some respect on LeVert’s name
Nash is trash at rotations good lord. Keep DJ in over Allen? Kill me
Beat the 76ers but lose to Grizzlies without Ja. Makes sense.
Steve Nash  is in over his head. MDA screaming at him in the final seconds doesn't look like it's going to work. Coaching by committee will be the death of this team especially since the star players think they know better
On the bright side: we beat Philly and only lost by 5 to Memphis without KD and Kyrie... gotta have some hope
Fitting the last play was a turnover
Woot.
Couldn't watch the game, but how come JV only played 14 minutes?
Live by the trap game, die by the trap game. 😔
Yikes Nets
Allen looked furious and rightly so. Steve Nash is a fucking moron, not putting Allen and Harris in to close out a close game feels like a move the Nets would’ve pulled four years ago while tanking
I feel like the Grizz really don't like the Nets for some reason lol
No excuses, cause they played like ass in the first half and then fought back into it and then let it slip away.

I do want to point out what a weird scheduling game this is. Just played 6 at home, and then have to fly overnight for a SEGABABA in Memphis, and now they're flying back to NY for 5 more (one at MSG)?

Maybe Kyrie ghosted cause he didn't wanna deal with that BS lol
We cant win any close games so far this year. We're 1-4 in games decided by 5 points or less. 

Need the get a handle on that quick.
I bet the BKN under, so every loss is met with glee. GG Grizz.
Going Vegan fried Kyrie's brain. Literally.
lol why is KD and Kyrie always out. do they text each other the night before and decide to sit out or something? bunch of divas
I'm very surprised with Nash's rotation down the stretch. Like did he want to concede the game? It gave us the opportunity to send 2,3 daggers.
Y’all need to lose more games so we can see that Ja Jalen Jaren big 3
What’s up with JV?
My guess is that it was managing the roster on the second night of a back-to-back where JA played more minutes than DJ last night. Even so, he still played 30 minutes. I’d like to think that playing JA in the 4th qtr wouldn’t have been the difference maker to win this game. Us bricking everything down the stretch in the 4th with no one other than Caris able to produce their own shot is what really hurt us. Oh and 21 turnovers.
KD/Kyrie told Nash he needs to play more, what else. The only reason you guys signed him was because he is BFF's with Kyrie/KD. He probably wouldn't be in the league if not for you guys
Such a wasted 40+ game too. They 100% see that win out with Harris and Allen, Jordan is beyond finished
Very efficient.
Don't forget how bad at coaching Nash was
This season is weird and understandably so.
bouncing around the power rankings like a fucking pinball
They looked dead in the first half. I assume the back to back hurt them a bit.
Back to back on the road I guess, team started flat
Yeahh. Dude balled in this game. It's gonna be 4 5 games again before he plays like this , so now you just gotta wait for that one.
JV was doing well vs Allen. I thought Allen would cook us when JV got pulled, but he didn’t really get the opportunity down the stretch.
Yea but you lost to a Grizz team without Ja, JJJ, Winslow, and ½ Jonas. We basically had 1.5 starters for this game. And that one starter was our worst starter.
Covid contact tracing or something.
They didn’t have their 3 best players...
They don't have Kyrie or KD and lost by 5
KD out cause of exposure to Corona virus for at least 3 more games
I’d love it, but I hate tanking.
I’m guessing contact tracing. He didn’t test positive.
They aren’t even with the team and JA has been starting the past few games so I highly doubt that
Lol no, DJ is just an average center, but he's a top tier back up C, especially if he's only costing the Nets $5m a year (KD + Kyrie took $2.5m paycuts each to supplement his contract). He's our fanbase's punching bag.

Like last night he was matched up against Dwight, who might be the most solid back up C in the league and DJ looked better. On top of that DJ has been and continues to be a solid locker room guy.
Jordan is not finished, he just felt lonely today ...
Have to blame the head coach for being away from the team, and putting Nash in that position in the first place.
Nah that’s not how Caris is. He gets in a rhythm and he’s great until he gets hurt
He also held his own against Embiid, and Dwight was knocking him around last night. He looked a little gassed tonight and unfortunately DJ is all we have otherwise.

Also gg
Listen man, I’m just trying to stay positive here
Has winslow played a game as a grizz yet? I feel like he's literally never healthy
Thank you!
We didn’t have our 4 best players
The problem though is one of those in the duo was out because he *checks notes* didn’t feel like it.  Like is this what the regular seasons going to be for Nets on non prime time slots?  At least Kawhi can blame his knees.  Brooklyn literally has to give a faded and acid washed ass DJ minutes over a better player that’s been in their core because a dude who decides when he wants to play basketball makes the rules for that team.
I think the team when healthy is too good to legitimately tank, and I don't think any of the guys currently injured have injuries the team can realistically hold them out much longer for.
Ohh okay. Should I pick up Tillman now?
Hah. Sorry. I mean the Nets are going to be great this year. Just very top heavy with Durant and Kyrie.
He's a mythical ghost. Never played a game once. He got close one time but I think he pulled his left nut.
KD and Kyrie are way more significant than anyone on your team
You’re right. Ja, JJJ, and valanciunas>KD, kyrie, dinwiddie
KD is out bc of COVID protocols
Sounds like a missed playoff & mid round draft pick to me which isn’t ideal
They are definitely better, but the implication that they are more hobbled than us was silly. Nets still had the best player on the court tonight.
Didn’t say they were better. Just saying both teams are missing their best players.
How, out of all those context clues, did you somehow gravitate to KD as your guess?
Because your entire point makes seem like if it were to be an occurring thing it affects both of them. If KD wasn't doing mandatory quarantining, he'd still be available. So you'd still have KD with this roster who again, lost by 5 to a Memphis backup squad.

Your issue comes from the fact that you don't like Kyrie's reason for not being on the team. My point in my OP was that they managed to barely lose despite not having their 2 best players and Steve's weird rotations tonight.
I understand your point, the excuse “they didn’t have KD/Kyrie” in a game where the other team was missing its major players and lost is at best just a short-sighted observation.  The bigger worry should be what Kyrie’s consistency is as a player, because he shows up and gives a 45 point performance like once a season and then is out for injury or “personal reasons” and people still act like he’s reliable.  This team doesn’t need to be fighting as much as it should and it’s 100% avoidable if Kyrie had it in him.  If the Nets require winning by Kyrie’s rules to be the standard they’re in trouble.
Slomo has dropped 20 in back to back games. 

He is like an intelligent counterweight to Dillon who is a moron.
at what cost, though
We got bailed out there. That call might have been correct but it's rarely called. 

LeVert really could have gotten a lot more foul calls.

I really like TLC. I really dislike TLC's left foot.

GG Nets.
That OT was super fuckin hard to watch lol
Will never understand the Nets love for DJ over Jarret Allen. The man had 15 rebounds in 22 minutes.
KYLE. ANDERSON.
OT was a brickfest.

Dillon Brooks looks like Danny Green and shoots like Danny Green.
Why were KD and Kyrie out?
Despite everything that went down, it was still a fun, sloppy, chaotic, enjoyable game. Though OT was quite brutal for the most part. Everyone pitched in. Though, we need to defend more and commit less turnovers. The bench should get more play time now that Ja's injured for a bit. I hope they use it to improve and get back in form. We will be relying them a lot.
We tossed up so many bricks during OT. GG Memphis

Also Dillon Brooks should not be allowed to wear #24
Caris with 29 shots
So I guess we got our first look at Nash coaching in crunchtime when he couldn't lean on KD/Kyrie and I wasn't really a fan. 

Leaving DJ in over Jarrett down the stretch looked really bad as he fumbled direct passes, blew defensive coverages and fought his teammates for uncontested rebounds, and not to mention how awful those post timeout plays were. Hopefully he learns from this and can make adjustments moving forward.
I knew Caris had to hard carry again, at least he delivered even when we didn't win.
What a weird week. Nets, Bucks, Clippers and Sixers lost and Warriors won
Steve Nash showing his rookie coaching.. those plays were so obvious.
Don't think a win has ever like more of a loss than this game.
Crazy that the Nets are about to start 2-4
Nets should've been able to beat a Ja-less Grizzlies

Even without Kevin and Irving
Yes. Defeated by Mr. Anderson himself
On one hand, we only lost by 5 without KD and Kyrie, but goddamn Nash doesn’t call any plays and keeps Jordan in way too long.
Chiozza was great, don’t understand why he didn’t get more shots toward the end. Also, Grizz fans - why the Dillon Brooks hate in this thread? He seems pretty good/a huge part of what the grizz are trying to do with this roster. Can someone explain this to me?
SlowMoSzn
What a fantastic game
Levert was good this game.

Good Job Memphis didn't expect you guys to pull through after Ja incident.

Our bench played well without Kyrie and Kd
That OT was some of the most brutal basketball I’ve ever watched
Wish that OT would have never happened.

That was brutal to watch.
Huh, so my boy Kurucs isn't getting minutes even when like half th team wasn't playing. Sad times.
We won.... but at what cost? Kill me now.
It’s real concerning that the Nets don’t run any plays.


It’s literally everyone standing around while someone else dribbles with a few off ball screens. Rarely do you see the team actually function in a half court offense. Pathetic. 


At least in years past the offense would be able to score points. I know you can’t force players to make shots but as bad as Kenny was with timeouts and substitutions at least they ran plays and competed. 


Even with the infinite amount of 10+ point blown halftime leads on the Nets record.
[He was moving so slowly, he was invisible to the naked eye](https://i.imgur.com/S9BcJcr.jpg)
That rushed Dillon shot at the end was classic cringe. Saved by BC.
Lmao. As a non-grizz fan who occasionally watch Memphis games because of Ja and JV, that dude is sometimes frustrating to watch.
Facts.. respect hated seeing ja limp off like that
I hope your guy's alright. It sucks to see anyone get injured like that.
Hope Ja’s alright man....GG
yeah, if you like lame shit like scoring
I’m trying to justify it by saying all the guys on both teams were extended minutes... but man that was just bad lol
The game ended 116-111 with OT? God damn
Tbh i thought the entire second half was hard to watch and it's not like the 1st half was some entertainment marvel...
he couldn’t hold on to the ball though.. had some serious butter fingers
Nobody on the nets love that besides DJ and KD and kyrie lmao. 

We all see it dosent work but kd wants dj starting idk why
That's Kyle "Career Game" Anderson to you.
But thinks he is prime AI
Load management. Both KD and Kyrie were recently injured/has a history of huge injuries so it's a loophole from the "star players has to play during national tv games" rule.
B2b
[deleted]
He chucks like a last season Kobe, though
If he continues to play like this he will probably not be allowed to wear a Grizzlies uniform by next season so you might get your wish.
I feel like you gotta earn the right to wear that number. No offense D brooks
He has tunnel vision. There was so many open looks for your best 3rd player Brandon Clarke it was crazy. For every hard bucket brook managed to score 5 secs later he either losses the ball or fouls 🤦‍♂️
Not just OT. Barclays Center was a goddamn Brick Factory tonight.
Wow. 10 more than Dillon Brooks.
American wiggins hitting different
I mean who else on the nets gunna out them up with no dinwiddie and durant and irving
Refs wouldn't give him a free throw all night
He almost had a 4x5 too, weird game
So what? Everyone was out and they almost won.
I dunno, I don't think JA stopped JV once this game. DJ made a lotta mistakes, but once he came in they stopped feeding JV the ball every single possession because it was no longer working
I was just wondering if the play at the end of the 4th was really just a step back three for Caris?
DeAndre made so many mistakes. I think we lose if Allen closes for you. DeAndre also let JV outrebound him and JV can barely move.
Scott Brooks-esque
Wasn't the rumor that DJ was part of the contingent that got Kenny fired? Allen is so clearly better than him at this point and I just don't understand otherwise why he doesn't get those situations
It looked like a Kenny Atkinson type decision
I wouldnt call 28 points on 30 shots ‘delivering’ but that’s just me
Aside from the hero 3
What'd he deliver?
2020 giving us one last fuck you and making us question our reality and sanity before it peaces out.
Don't forget no JJJ or Justise
uh....no
Don't forget we were down Ja, JJJ, and Justise...  We had Konchar, Tillie, and Allen on the floor together at one point 😆
A lot of the hate comes from his play in the bubble lasts season. After jjj got injured he had a much bigger role that he honestly wasn't fit for. He would often overlook an open teammate to jack up a contested shot 

That being said, he looks like he has improved his playmaking this season and has made an effort to look for his teammates more. I don't get the hate for this game, he had the most assists on the team, had the best +/- on the team, and shot well. All the while playing solid defence on levert.

Honestly I think most of the hate is just a lasting effect from the bubble.
top two point guards didn't play, not surprising to see that type of result
This is sounding like last year's clippers?
Drax or invisible boy from mystery men?
He genuinely has the worst decision making I have ever seen and I watch a lot of basketball
I was so skeptical when we first signed him but he's one of my favorite players I've ever watched. He's so unpredictable
What am I missing? He had a good game last night.
Oh yeah. Wasn’t silver going to implement a rule against that?
24 points on 58% true shooting and forcing LaVert into a stupidly inefficient shooting night with his defense.  Yall are crazy for hating on Dillon this game.
He was one of the best players in the game, what the fuck are people smoking?
[deleted]
Why tf does Dillion take so much shots??
Wiggins would need like 8 games to hit 11 assists haha.
Levert can at least distribute really well.
American Wiggins lmaao
FWIW wiggins has had a triple double.
You make a good point. JA's weakness has always been big, competent centers. He's been getting devoured for years by Embiid, JV, Gasol, and other decent bigs in the East. He's a traffic cone when it matters. There was nothing wrong with trying something different there, which in this case was rolling with DJ.
JV's one of the best rebounders in the NBA. It's not exactly a huge shame to be out rebounded by him
Well he was our best player on the floor that kinda goes with it.
Should’ve gotten many more calls, he only took 2 FT’s
lmao but tatum has 30 points on 28 shots on opening night celtics fans we're calling it him entering his 'superstar form' because his awful shot at the end luckily banked in
28/4/11 with 5 steals. Yeah he did deliver. Wish he could’ve done a bit more but it was a great performance. But sure him shooting 41% from the field means something else.
He really should've drove or taken a mid-range. You could tell he was gassed towards the end.
Being the best player on the floor.
Yes
Most the time when he touches the ball I just yell at my TV like, "don't you dare shoot this one you son of a bitch. Pass it. Pass it you asshole"  

Then he comes off the screen and takes an elbow jumper or a fadeaway three. Every fucking time.  

Meanwhile my wife is glaring at me because the baby is trying to sleep. This game is killing me.
Same... the crazy thing is that in the second half of the spurs game he showed flashes of good passing. It’s like he thinks he has to take every shot in order for us to win regardless of shot clock/other people that are open.
Baldwin was pretty bad.
Up until last game I was pretty not in favor of Kyle getting big minutes since he can't really shoot, can't really create for himself. But then the last few games he's been a decent shooter and somehow makes his weird float flippy shots go in so I'm all game
Right? Like, he was great tonight! What game did these people watch?
He got his big contract in January and has been walking brick since then smh
With JJJ, Justise, and now Ja out...

He kinda has to.
He has tunnel vision and thinks he’s Kobe. I like his confidence but there’s no IQ there to match it
TLC played much better. Even Chiozza was a better pg, when they weren’t on the floor at the same time.
Context my dude. Tatum averaged 23 ppg for a season and 26 ppg in the playoffs. That was just another game in the mix
I didnt watch the game. I was just here for the memes. That actually looks like a pretty well rounded performance
30 shots...lol
What does that say when the best player on the floor doesn't deliver the win then
Blame it on Dillon bruh. I hate watching him play
It wasn’t a big contract
This comment reminded me of Justice Winslow’s existence tbh
I mean he still takes a fuck ton of shots with ja and jjj hahah but yeah now more than ever we need hero brooks
Is... Is Winslow ever coming back?
Ehh TLC started off real hot but couldn't hit anything in the 2nd half, plus he had a lotta bad TO's, had more then LeVert. Cheeze was solid, but also couldn't really make a basket.

Games like these really show how big it is to have guys that can create their own shots.
Huh? It means that basketball is a 5 v 5 sport... You sound like Skip Bayless talking about LeBron
"CoNfIdEnCe Of KoBe!"
I...

yes.
I know how many players play the game that's why I was asking what did Levert deliver specifically, seeing as how OP singled him out rather than say the team as a whole failed to deliver the W
MaMba MeNtAlItY
He shot pretty inefficiently, but he "delivered" 28 pts, 11 assists, and 5 steals. He played solid d and hit timely buckets on the 2nd night of a b2b. He was tied for highest +/- at 7, which includes the garbage time final 4 fts. What do you even mean by deliver?
Oh you're a Knicks fan so I guess you don't know what a good player is. Let me explain, you see a good player is someone who shows up and can be the best player on the floor on any given day, the team either wins or loses but you can't deny that the player delivered.
I didn't bring up the term deliver initially but I'm just curious what's the point of even bringing up that word when we're talking about a loss
Lol no one can have a conversation on this sub without backhanded flair jabs how immature. I'm sorry I just think when it comes to title contenders you shouldn't take moral victories when it comes to a loss in Avery winnable game
Hmm seems like you're nitpicking to be a dick to be honest. Let's imagine the Knicks lose a close game but RJ had a pretty big night and was the best player out there, how would you describe it?
What would you know about being title contenders?
I'd say he played well but I wouldn't say he delivered, what'd he deliver? A loss?
As much as you know about the word deliver
Effort I guess lol. Either way you seem like a dude itching for a fight over Reddit over word definition. I'm good. Good luck to the Knicks this year, if you guys are decent NYC basketball will be that much more exciting.
What would a Knicks fan know about delivering? Lmao.
I'm wasn't even looking for a fight I was genuinely asking lol but whatever
I said as much as YOU know about the word deliver, not what I know about the word deliver, learn to read my man
Knicks fan big mad now.
gg, hornets played great all game long
Yes, as we all predicted going into the season, the dominant Nets would destroy Golden State and Boston before losing their first game of the season to the Charlotte Hornets.
Maybe MJ had some premonition when he signed Gordon to that monster contract
the east runs through us
Gotta give credit to these hornets commentators, they literally made this game so fun to watch.

We gotta get these guys commentating on national TV sometime.
If TLC doesn't get ALL of Taurean Prince's minutes I am rioting
Eric Collins is a national treasure
Everyone: This Nets team looks unbeatable. 
MJ: I took that personal.
70-2 BABY LETS GOOOOO
TERRY ROZIER, OH MY GOODNESS!
No overreaction from me here, just flat and hornets were fun to watch. Really like Miles Bridges man he’s dope af
Couple of observations:

Kevin Durant is automatic. This dude is incredible, even with that bricked final shot.

Awesome to see Hayward knock down shot after shot in the beginning of the fourth. I’ve always been rooting for this guy.

The Hornets are super raw. Lots of sloppy plays but they have a lot of potential and more importantly, they’re actually pretty fun to watch.

The rotation for the Nets are weird, but I’m gonna chalk that up to early season experimentation by the Nets’ coaching staff. I wouldn’t panic if I were a Nets fan. They’ve still got a TON of talent in their team.

As a neutral fan, this game was a lot of fun to watch!
KD should've buried that last shot
This hornets team gonna be my league pass team this year. so much fun to watch. Gordon Hayward is showing everyone why charlotte signed him tot aht 100 mil contract
MJ knew what he was doing. Rozier + Hayward dayum
here for the overreactions, hit me
KD AND KYRIE ARE LITERALLY BUDGET HAYWARD AND ROZIER. THANK YOU FOR THE OVERPAID PLAYERS BOSTON. WE'LL BE OFFERING DANIEL THEIS A 5 YR 100M CONTRACT THIS OFF SEASON.
#STEVE NASH IS NO LONGER UNDEFEATED AS AN NBA HEAD COACH
Damn didn’t realize Abraham Lincoln coached the Hornets
[deleted]
TERRY ROZIER! HOW DO YOU DO?
64 to 26 points in the paint says it all imo

Absolute night and day energy, effort, and performance from Saturday fair fucking play I was livid yesterday. Offense wasn't as rigid also


Yes we got lucky early on with Brooklyn missing a lot of open threes that they'd normally hit

But the activity and energy on the glass, especially from Miles, PJ, and Biz, was just stellar


Hayward played like a $30m man tonight. 28/6/7 on great efficiency
gg Hornets.. you deserved that W.
Let the hot takes change direction now!  From destined dynasty to disastrous! =)

Hornets are dynamos!  2nd half of a back to back and they still move like ferrets on crack.

Nets had some stellar defensive plays in the final minute but had a lot of spottiness on both ends throughout especially 2nd half.

I'm disappointed to lose of course, but still generally happy with how it's looking...the season is young!

Hoping Din is okay, and that we can improve moving forward and maybe survive tomorrow's game?

Nice win, Charlotte!

On to tomorrow.  *Let's Go Nets!*  [](/BKN) **BROOKLYN!!!**
I am here to celebrate the announcing team of Charlotte
I love how ecstatic those announcers were. Also, Hayward fits that home jersey so fine for some reason.
So was every championship contender unable to celebrate Christmas with their families until yesterday?
GG Hornets. Hayward looked great, our bench really shat the bed, KD despite missing that last FG still looks amazing
GG, plz report Washington for INT feeding
Fuck you Prince and Shamet. Again, that is all.
That dunk by Rozier over Durant was HUGE. One of the best point guard dunks I've seen in a while, especially over a 6'10 guy like KD.
Bismack Biyombo is my father
I’m just here to see all the reactions from people who claim to be an NBA fan but have never watched the Hornets before
Hornets commentators were freaking awesome
How soon can the Nets trade Shamet?

Only 50% joking. He needs to start playing better. Can't be going 0-8 from 3.

Anyways, great effort and play from Charlotte. They came to play and Hayward and co. were excellent for stretches and weren't awed by KD or Kyrie.

On to the next one.
You just lost to the Charlotte Hornets lmao
Lose to the CAVS and OKC, but beat NETS on b2b? Fine, whatever
Would have bet my bottom dollar that KD makes that 2 pointer near the end...
CAVS VS HORNETS ECF LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Hayward and Irving both looked great that game. 

Washington was having a great game until the final few minutes. Seemed like he tensed right up when the score got tight
Landry 0-8 Prince 0-5 lol
Great physical game.

Not enough sage to go around
atrocious shooting this game
So close. GG tho
Hornets have a squad! I watched every Nets v Hornets game last season too and they were always fun. PJ Washington did some dumb shit to make the game close, upsetting that Kyrie/KD couldn't deliver but still went on a great run to come back. Jarret Allen looks good, can't wait to see how he progresses this season. No idea how Terry shoving him wasn't a tech, but either way, gg hornets
Shamet and Prince combined 0/13 from 3 and 0/15 from the field
Sadness
Nets fell apart without the Widster
Issues from the first two games were still present here.

1. Dinwiddie's talent is completely going to waste right now. He needs to be on the floor with lineups where he can have the ball in his hands more.
2. The offense is just KD and Kyrie ISO. A lot of standing around for the 4 guys who don't have the ball.
3. The full line changes need to stop. Minutes need to be staggered. 
4. Prince is horrible, but hopefully Nash uses TLC instead now.
Always love the Gordon Hayward revenge game
[deleted]
Hayward + Rozier > Irving + Durant
watching pj washington made me want to die
Man PJ Washington was trying hard to lose the game in the 4th
TLC was fucking clutch, I love that frenchman
TLC needs to take Shamets and Princes minutes. He worked really well with that closing unit. Him and Allen should start, and have Spence and Caris come off the bench.
So today:

* Clippers lost by 50 to the Mavs
* Nets lost to the Hornets
* Bucks BTFO by the Knicks
* Sixers BTFO by the Cavs
* Warriors might lose to the Bulls

Twolves should just go off to complete the upsets
Kevin Durant : my next chapter, this one stings 🐝
That fourth quarter was a comedy of errors from everyone, Hornets were making some standard young guy mistakes. Great win though, and a start to Lil Gordo's All-Star campaign.
The real 'Nets won
The Hornets' play by play guy yelling like they won the chip lol

Nice win tho
Cavs, Hornets, Magic, & Knicks winning games today!
Hayward heard y'all talking shit hahaha bcrazy game
Just goes to show these early games don't mean much
As soon as the ref tore his ACL I knew we were in for a crazy fourth quarter.
Good win by the Hornets, thought the Nets would come back after that run but Hornets hung in there, Nets not staggering Kyrie/KD is a problem especially with Dinwiddie going down

Hayward is a legit great player great scoring, playmaking and he was even playing good defense

Wanna shoutout the Hornets play by play announcer, tuned in to watch the game a bit and stayed for him, great excitement in plays, he's funny and not biased that's what we need

Also a ref pulled his calf and they ended up with 2 refs never seen that
And of course it's the overpaid Hornet players the ones that choose to buttfuck us wow
hayward mid range looked smooth glad to see him hopping again.this may be GM best decision.
i really like bridges too.
Lamelo could played better i think it clear rozier doesnt like him or just doesnt want to share the ball.

hey kyrie the cuy you talked about who could make that shit where he at?
It's opposite day!
Can we let DJ and Shamet walk home
And I forgot to say praise TLC
That Shamet/Prince dual performance was really quite something to behold
I miss Gordon so damn much.
LMAO YOU LOST TO THE FUCKING HORNETS
Steve Nash really should stagger KD and kyries minutes a little bit at least
Bruh Landry Shamet was absolute garbage today.. if he made a shot they would’ve won
i suppose ill take 71-1
Wtf
We know r/nba secretly root for the hornets when they do good
Shamet thought he was still on the clippers with that shooting performance
Today a memorable one for sure
Not putting the blame on him at all, and Hornets played great, but Kyries late game decision making has always been suspect to me. He raised some dumb hero ball shots, which make him look like the best point guard in the league when he makes them, but leaves it scratching your head when he doesn’t. That one random 28 footer and that drive into two defenders that was easily blocked by biyombo  that would’ve tied the game reeeeeally stopped momentum. 

But regardless, none of this matters if shamet and Prince weren’t playing with blindfolds on.
Good game Hornets

I'm not too worried about this loss as long as Nash recognizes that Prince is hot trash and needs to be in the gleague. I don't give prince a long time in the NBA. I think he will be done once his contract is up. ATL fans were happy he is gone and he has not been good for Nets.

Shamet is just as bad but I don't know how bad he was with the clippers so I give him more time.
This is gonna be a weird season, huh?
Landry Shamet is the worst player of this season (till now)
Kyrie forgot to burn sage in Charlotte.
No gods no masters
I hope the hornets have a good year. Serious team of rejects and every part of the franchise is always written off. Would be great if they came good.
Basketball is funny sometimes.
Hornets played hard all game didn’t seem scared of the Nets at all I like them but I hope Kyrie drop 50 on y’all next game lmfao this put a stain on my night
ESPN: The Charlotte Hornets (1-2) defeat the Brooklyn Nets (2-1) 106-104 behind LaMelo Ball 6/5/5
The ref that had a cramp is actually what would happen when this sub says "I could ref better than these guys".
Gordon Hayward with another ok game
Why can’t the Celtics get guys like that?
This thread is definitely going to be filled with logical and reasonable takes
lmao at the ppl who think gordon hayward shouldnt have been paid. he was the best player charlotte would ever get in fa. Sit down reddit analysts
[Dear Nets](https://i.imgur.com/7ySysM6.jpg)
[deleted]
I thought Kyrie said that KD was the only teammate he had who could hit the clutch shots late? 👀
As we all expected would happen.

Absolute night and day from the first two games.
GAME. BLOUSES.
Nash really playing with fire with no staggering at all. Full bench every time and Lavert taking like pull-up after pull-up isn't ideal. Also TLC>Prince gotta be the way.
The Hornets are not the Nets. When they have a double digit lead, they know how to hold it
I love a good trap game to cap off my weekend.
Not a well coached game by Nash, but he's obviously got a ton of room to grow.
Gordon Hayward for MVP.
KD not clutch confirmed! /s
Bad game by the Nets...
LaVar Ball tricked yall man
‘Finally someone else who can make that shot’
No shame in losing to Michael Jordan
Bench Jordan, unleash Claxton
Nets don't need DJ and Allen. They need to go pick up PJ Tucker and get some value for those young players.

The hornets are better they've been but the pecking order is a little suspect.
Nash needs to start Allen, and TLC needs more minutes.
Shoulda had bridges closing the game instead of Washington but got away with it
What’s happened to shamet? Was his rookie season his best season?
9/32 from the nets bench today was pretty damning. Levert with a typical Levert game, lol Landry. Give me some damn Bruce Brown minutes already.
Just a really sloppy performance. We did not deserve to win
https://imgur.com/aaridy6
PJ tried his hardest to throw the game. 2 offensive fouls and 2 missed FTs and 1 air ball with 2 minutes left on the clock and a 2pt game.
I'M HERE TO OVERREACT , NETS 1ST ROUND EXIT
mvp pg and kyrie died today but hey we still got mvp fultz
2nd best player of all time right infront of lebron and right behind MJ. We keep him in a cage and throw crackers at his head all game until we need him for moments like that. Always comes through tho
There is one guy out there who just betted on the knicks, cavs and hornets and got a fat wallet coming his way
Hornets hustled for the win, but it’ll be interesting to see the report tomorrow, lmao. They injured half our team.

And I have no words for Shamet/Prince.
yo! what happened to the ref? did they say what his injury was?
After yesterday's game since OKC best the Hornets and the Hornets just beat the Nets...
Does this mean OKC is a contender?!?
Why did Monk get a DNP? He is a top 10 pick in the draft and getting DNP (Coach's decision). That doesn't sound good
Hornets are GOAT
If Hayward stays fit he could be an all star again. 20pts 7ast a game are good numbers
This team will never stop giving me whiplash and I unfortunately love it
Where are the reddit box scores?
We might just be the best team in the NBA
4th quarter was exciting. Congrats to the Hornets! Can't win 'em all.
The Hayward Era begins.
love seeing gordon hayward playing well
Looking at the box score, still no idea how we won
Gordon hayward has been looking great
Kyrie told me to trust that game winning shot more with KD than anyone else
In case anyone forgot Hayward is pretty good.
What the actual fuck is happening
Gordon Hayward got come Celtic Comeback performance in him towards Kyrie. Now they are both on different teams and one isn't doing to good and the other is.
The Hornets remind me a lot of 2018-2019 Nets. Super scrappy, lots of depth and youth, and they'll be in a lot of close games. Where they differed is that they actually won a close game tonight and the Nets lost a ton of those lol
Uh oh!!
So the hornets are the real deal this season *wow emoji*
Taurean Prince is fucking awful and he needs to not be on this team anymore. 

Still willing to give Shamet another try but Prince has got to go.
Knicks-Hornets ECF incoming
Landry Shamet was 0 help. Turnovers didn't help either but that was atrocious shooting by shamet tonight.
Ahhh so today was "opposite day" in the NBA.
what a strange fucking year
Does anybody know why the box score is not added to the post? I saw it only on one game thread (I'm using the app on android)
Gotta say I underestimated the Hornets. Great win for them last night
Just goes to show; makes sense to stop making sweeping conclusions in the beginning of the season.
Oof. Dinwiddie out and a loss to the Hornets. Way to make the hype die down
Didn’t Kyrie say something about trusting KD to take the last shot?
I am confused. I thought KD and Kyrie won the title already?
Nets need Harden
What a game! Kyrie seemed downbeat for most of it with Durant giving them a late run.

Hornets have a good team.
@Celtics got anyone else we can “overpay”?
 Hayward  is a poor-man's LeBron James.  Star, veteran, wing, who can score and  facilitate and KNOWS HOW TO RUN A HALF-COURT OFFENSE!

There are very, very few players in the league with that specific set of skills.  This was a masterstroke signing by MJ.
The Nets *were* scary.
[deleted]
The first step to Kyrie demanding a trade starts now
Kyries shot selection....
LeBron: i heard durant was clutch ?
"I drink your milkshake" - Gordon Hayward
KD lowkey choked
I thought Kyrie and KD were supposed to be clutch. What happened at the end there?
Welp can't win every game. Any team including the crappy one's can win I guess.
Caris Levert is a poor man's Jamal Crawford, change my mind
Hats off to em, that fight back from 16 down in the 4th was valiant but they managed to hold on.
Their announcers are super chill too. Watched on NBA TV since I am out of market for the next week or so and enjoyed their commentary, pretty unbiased.
Gg
As we all predicted. The reigning champions Lakers would get beat by the Clippers who in turn would get daddy schlonged by the Mavericks

Also whatever tf is happening in New York rn
who would win? the Durant-Kyrie-LeVert-Dinwiddie-Allen lineup that was never going to lose again

or five buzzy bois
Your team's really exciting to watch, man. Plus I love that both teams didn't use their timeouts the entire time down the stretch, made my heart race the entire fourth. Every game should be like that.
bruh y’all team dad dicked us. was a great game to watch. the Hornets play some real high energy, gritty ball
[deleted]
Hornets lookin a lil nasty this year tbh
Destroying Golden State without Draymond is not looking like a very impressive feat tbh
They play 7 game series in the playoffs for a reason
I think that MAYBE all the hot takes after the first two games MIGHT be a bit premature.
Going for that front office GOAT too
My only question is who is your 3rd option this season and can we max him this summer?
big market teams can laugh, but this was honestly the biggest star we could've gotten for a while. Also MJ's liked him since he was at Utah.
Hayward played well last season and still scored 20ppg next to tatum, kemba, and brown. He still gonna be good this year
MJ fed Hayward that secrit juice
To be honest, it's not signing Hayward that would bother me as a Hornets' fan. Quality free agents are hard to sign for Charlotte. What would bother me is the fact that they had to waive stretch Batum's expiring contract. That's 9 M/ dead cap for 3 years. That clean cap sheet Charlotte was being praised for went out the window. They couldn't have sent the SF Batum to Ainge in the sign-and-trade? Ainge would have taken it  as a trade chip over what he actually got.
Barring injuries, Hayward was really underrated. Hornets aren't exactly a big market place, so its hard to attract stars. But, maybe this a sign of a good team that can make it deep into the playoffs
I mean Hayward has always been good. I understand his health being a gigantic concern and red flag but if healthy the dude has entered extremely underrated territory
Honestly Gordon has been looking way better than I expected, I hope he keeps it up
I'm telling you, Hayward was a GREAT signing.  We have such talent in these young guys.  We just needed an unselfish, veteran, Star-player who is 'team-first' and can lead them.  He's truly a revelation imo.  He sets the tone of unselfishness.  Just watch that game against the Nets and see how many shots people passed up to get it to someone more open.  That's NEW.  He and LaMelo are fucking GOLDEN additions to this team.
don't forget how much we got for signing Terry. MJ knew he would poster KD
The Hive stay protected 😤
Uhh, Cavs are undefeated friend, talk shit after you visit SexLand.
I love them. They're great at calling the game and always respectful to the other team and super knowledgeable.
In some ways it's a blessing only having one nationally broadcast game a season. More of EC and Dell.
Best duo in the NBA, every game is a blast
I live in NYC and literally buy league pass just so I can hear Eric and Dell
I also really like them. Think they might be the best NBA announcers
[deleted]
Prince and Shamet only needed to hit 1 shot for this to go to OT. How do they both go 0-14 combined. Especially Shamet who was open in the corner multiple times.
Prince and Shamet lost this game, 0/14 combined and 13 of those being 3PA 🤦‍♂️
Tender Loving Cabarot
And Shamets
He’s got a nice stroke.
Looked like he wanted every shot in the forth and he made the ones he got count.
Every time I heard the announcer call his name I was screaming.

I'm glad he didn't take many shots cause he looked pristine when he did.
Prince is so trash, I was happy whenever he was on the court vs us.
I feel like you could see Nash increasing TLCs minutes and roster role during this game
i was so impressed by your announcers, wow!!!!!!!
The best commentator in the game
GOT ITTTTTTTTTT
When we win the championship someday, he'll be da real (finals) mvp
HOW DO YOU DO!!
Yeah this was my first time watching the Hornets (sorry guys, I'm a casual) in forever, and I was really enjoying the commentary. Good fun team to watch, gonna tune in more often!
You just don’t get that genuine excitement anywhere else. Dude fucking loves appreciating basketball.
Landry shamet*
Everyone’s ready to crown them lmao
What’s Brooklyn to a Biyombo
Thanks man, really looks like miles is taking a step forward this year
Flat, like the Earth perhaps?
Idk if you saw what he did at the end of the Thunder game, dude hit 3 3’s in a row and has been really impressive. I think he worked hard on his outside shot this off-season because he gets hype as heck whenever he hits a 3 lol
Yea hopefully spence is okay
It's going to be season long experimentation for the nets. New system which is TBD. New coaching staff, no training camp or real preseason, teams will eventually plan for KD and kyrie since they haven't established a system.
>*Kevin Durant is automatic. This dude is incredible, even with that bricked final shot.*

I missed this. Is Lebron off somewhere dancing because of that Kyrie comment?
TBH after watching 2 Nets games I'd give KD the drive and overplay the shot. He gets easy buckets pulling from everywhere. I bet he is avoiding contact if possible
“Kyrie would have hit that” -Kyrie
He just broke Kyrie’s new acquired confidence in him
Loving watching him rise from the ashes
Whats that mean? Can you only choose one team? I've never had league pass and by the sounds of it never will
If you watched him in the last game, you wouldn't have felt so great about him.
I mean I think it’s a good combo, I liked both players as celtics, especially rozier. But honestly people are getting carried away here. They are really good players, but they have free reign over there to do whatever they want. Just like marcus morris on the knicks last season. All really good players that get to look much better being top options on bad teams
Gordon Hayward needs more money
Cavs > Nets

East still runs through Cleveland
Hornets will make the playoffs, Hayward will be a allstar.
Hornets Kings NBA finals lets go
Kyrie, Tatum and Brown were holding Rozier and Hayward back
MJ signed hayward cuz he needed a white guy to surpass him
Hayward is underpaid, Nash is a Canadian fraud, etc. etc.
Terry Rozier is a better point guard than Kyrie
Nate Darling is a better shooter than Shamet
Cavs are ergo better than the nets
Charlotte's gonna beat Brooklyn in the 9-8 play in game.
I'm ready for the Charlotte-Orlando Eastern Conference Finals
The Nets are frauds and Gordon Hayward needs a supermax
Hornets win more then 40 games
Landry Shamet gonna be MVP candidate in 2 years
Shamet may not win MVP after all.
Is Nash ever going to stagger Kyrie and KD? The all bench lineup won't get it done every night and separating KD/Kyrie could help them.
Biyombo lifetime contract
Best part is that neither look overpaid
Had a sour outing with Rozier with him wanting for money and command, but since then even last year he balled a bit and I'm glad hayward isn't injured already, definitely a team that's fun to watch! And oh yeah we keep theis for a couple more years atleast he's too young, you guys can have Tristan after his breakout year for 3 85 or somethin.
loses whenever tottenham doesnt win im calling it.
Thank fuck for that
four score and seven possessions ago
Lmao I subconsciously was thinking this all night and just realized it when I read this
we know what it’s like to be an underrated team.. no ego here, y’all deserved that W
Nets fans were on the same boat as hornets not too long ago. We’re always an underdog and have no ego
The long time fans are the reasonable ones, we've been through hell and lots of bad luck so we know how it feels. Anyone that comes at you with the "KD/KYRIE TRASH" or ones that overreact at any loss, those are the new guys
We are, yet still get clowned for being realistic.
Being a bottom of the barrel team with no future certainly humbles most fans.
Because if the price of spanking the Celtics was losing to the Hornets, I’d do it every time.
I survived the 12-70 season lol. I'll just cherish every second KD & Kyrie put on the Nets jersey.
It is early. Also they dont have as many bandwagoners as they will get if they do well
wtf happened all of a sudden?  He looks like a different player this season!
That- was a crazy game.
‘Ferrets on crack’ may be my favourite description of the hornets ever, thank you!
cause he's a white guy that's good at basketball.
Missing Dinwiddie is huge...no real playmakers on the bench
[Here's another good guard dunk for ya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UStJXW07wM)
It made me feel like I was watching Baron Davis
We’re finally the best at something
If the Clips hadn't utterly shit the bed earlier this wouldve been so much worse for Nets fans.
Yo Hornets are decent imo
That’s Hornets basketball!
he was so money from there all day too.    
Lebron is great, but KD is the most automatic bucket I've ever watched play the game.
Sexland vs Buzz City im here for it
It was real close and intense.  Love the physical nature between PJ and Jarrett
> No idea how Terry shoving him wasn't a tech

Because Allen intentionally went out of his way to step over and drag his nuts across PJ's face.  He's lucky all he got was a shove and a common foul.  That was punk ass move by Allen trying to goad a call
He’s played like ass early on this season. Just starting slowly I think
I thought he was great today. He set the tone for being physical the entire game.
Cavs are f’ing 3-0!
Warriors losing to the bulls isn’t an upset, they’re ass
keep going
Clever
That's him literally every game, and he's a treasure
That's our ship.  Every year we beat one very very good team and it thrives our fanbase's unrealistic hopes for another season and offseason.
That underdog parlay though
Eric Collins is the best. Has just enough home team bias but keeps the energy high across the board.
Lamelo played great but just didn't get enough touches. He's still integrating with the team so I assume he's trying to be a team player and letting Rozier/Graham run the show.

The coach is notorious for playing rookies on a short leash and making them earn minutes. I have no doubt Lamelo will be getting a consistent 25+ min in a month or so.
yeah. 100%
He really sucks
Looks like it.
[deleted]
you can't be serious
Find a new hobby
What can you do when you get no minutes or freedom?
i mean he played ok today, 6/5/5 in 20 min isnt bad
Say it again, Chuck!
Funny how no one discusses all the misses
TLC and Bruce Brown about to get their chance to break into the rotation after that performance by Shamet and Prince.
Lavert went full Melo mode when Dinwiddie left
no we dont lol
You must not know about Hornets basketball
In the post season he’s not clutch, look at the statistics.
KD, Kyrie and Spence probably all sit. We’re gonna run with that bubble team. TLC, Tyler and Cheeze probably all play big minutes tomorrow.
Looked like a cramp but I haven’t heard anything else
COVID recovery
I hope he can make it through a few healthy seasons here.
Yeah well games 1 and 2
I don’t know what happened to him, I thought he was awesome in ATL
You uh... want Kemba back?
He was so bad down the stretch, I mean really terrible.
He seems to have regressed from last year. Borrego preseason was talking about how he's not really in shape yet. Not good.
Still shot that motherfucker at a ridiculous 60 percent clip
Lol wat
Kyrie was pretty clutch at the end, kd missed by an inch. The scary terry effect
Bismack Biyombo muthafukkerrrrr
They singlehandedly brought the game back from a 14 pt lead. Before a no call on a tech occurred.
Hayward doing Hornets things
Honestly this L is on Nash. Left the subs for way too long. Nets were down 6ish for a while, then the Hornets expended the lead to 16 with something like 7 minutes to go. 

Should have put the starters back in earlier and not wait for the collapse, since you could already see in the second quarter the subs are getting somewhat overwhelmed by the Hornets.
Oh our announcer are very biased but their commentary is so good other fanbases rarely care
they are certainly hornets biased, but not anti other team.  They will hype another teams Heat check or dunk.
Bro wtf is happening in New York and Cleveland rn the Sixers and Bucks are like down 30 each
The Mavericks who were coming off a blowout loss to the Lakers.

Less than a week into the season and we’ve already completed an excellent three team circle of suck.
Number 22 is busy trying life on Earth right now.

(Sorry just watched Soul on Disney+ and really enjoyed the shade thrown at Knicks)
League is off to a wild start looking at the scores tonight.  Well, the scores today.  Can’t forget what happened earlier.
To be fair fun guy is out
Lol Hornets go buzzzzzzz
I mean Dinwiddie left in the middle of the 3rd before the Hornets got a huge lead, but yeah
it was so fun to watch.  The Hornets are actually FUN TO WATCH!  Like...  wtf??  The announcer might be the best of any team.
I mean tbh, we're missing #1 screen player in the league who is actually a huge part of our offense. We're not known as the Charlotte BigWhiteGuys for nothing
dude.  they're gonna be good.  the question is how good will LaMelo be.  if he's GREAT, then the Hornets could actually, FINALLY have a fucking FUTURE!
Facts they can definitely slide into a playoff spot if other team slack
8th seed is gonna be a bloodbath this year
I mean it’s not but we also put it to the Celts the other night. And tonight KD and Kyrie were still slaying. Our bench just decided to all actively suck at the same time. Bad games happen. We still have along season.
Heard LeBron talking about how he wanted to own a team and Jordan took it personally.
If Gordon plays like he has the past two nights we have a chance, what the hell is this team lmaoooo
"Danny Ainge called me a chump for giving Hayward those 💰💰.. and I took it personally"

— MJ, Probably
You ever heard of Kemba Walker?
I have one lightly used Semi Ojeleye for you..
A lot of people on this sub just don't get this. Small markets have to play a completely different game when it comes to Free Agency.
You guys have “signed” him twice right ?
Its not just that tho.  Hayward is such a perfect fit in Charlotte.  He's also been relegated to a much lighter role lately than his skill-set should grant him.  He's finally got the perfect place to shine as the number-one option, and his unselfishness is contagious.  It's fucking perfect!  Now lets just hope he stays healthy.
Also if he stays healthy he’s 100% worth that contract. It’s not like we chased him out of town, we still offered him over 100 million. 

The biggest thing was he wanted to be a first option again.
What bigger star have you gotten previously?
People forget how good he was before the injury. Him signing for Boston was huge, he was one of the very few stars to leave the West for the East.
He was about 18 / 7 / 4 while mostly the fourth option so that’s pretty good. He did look lost quite a bit though.
Well tbh we can’t get people like Hayward in Charlotte when we have money generally so I’m ok with the stretch
They were very respectful and the foul calls were unbiased in their eyes. Really enjoyed it. Though their commentary about "2 points for the good guys" was too much lol, felt more Disney movie than NBA. But they brought the energy and give respect. Super impressed
Nothing wrong with having preferences, but the New York Knicks have Mike Breen and Walt Frazier, for me that’s the best commentator team in sports￼
thats me in Chicago
shamet has regressed every year since his rookie year. I have no idea what happened to him
EC and Dell complement each other perfectly, and they have a great balance of enthusiastically supporting the Hornets and admiring the opposing team's good plays.
We mustn't lose him
I can't wait until we have a legit good team just to hear EC get excited every night
TBF the Clippers did have a bad shooting night.
Cmon now don’t be apart of the hyperbole
Biyombo looked like a savage tonight (on the back of the back2back...and yesterday looked absolutely FINISHED like he was 40 years old. Which he might still be
Lol why do I even bother on this sub with Kyrie on my team /s
really hurt the Nets for him to go down so early. Our guards' defense is one of our major weaknesses and while Kyrie got to his spots, LeVert struggled and I think we would have had a lot more trouble guarding Dinwiddie. I hope for a quick recovery
Ironic that the Nets most durable player last season is the first to get injured. Hopefully it’s nothing serious.
Pretty terrible situation for a almost non existent training camp lol
Idk why people are acting like he was a scrub last year. He averaged 17-5–5 on good efficiency as a 3/4th option. He just needs to stay healthy, if he’s healthy all year the best series is a lot more competitive.
League pass team is usually just how people refer to a team they like to watch who isn't on national tv often.
I don't got league pass either, just means it's the team I'm watching this year when there's a lot of games on. Just the saying people use for low key fun team to watch
Hayward plays better in red states. I'm sorry liberals but the stats just do not lie
he got kids to feed
i said overreactions
ok cant beat this
Our sub was in meltdown mode after the first 2 games but maybe the cavs and OKC are just that good
I mean they are up 20 on the 6ers right now... The Cavs backcourt is young and hungry as fuck.
Keep going I’m close
If this happens this year I will eat a shoe.
Guess that’ll be two guys that surpassed MJ since Bron already has.
Yeah Rozier deal reminds me sort of the deal Kemba had before he broke out offensively.  Rozier still isn't the best facilitator but he's added a nice midrange game and floater/finger role game.  His athleticism is still on.
Damn I have to root for Mourinho now?
Why are you thanking fuck ?
Nets fans are now in weird position of suddenly having lots of new friends.
Anyone who had to live through the pre or post Kidd era would definitely have to be humbled.
I've had a soft spot for the Nets since they traded the farm for Deron Williams.
Teams that suck for a while and then get good are almost always at an extreme. Either the fanbase is way more assholish than average (pent up rage at the losing, feeling like they get to pay back for all the shit they took over the years) or way nicer than average (having a great perspective on it and having sympathy for the other guy).
It was ugly, but yall deserved it
And somehow we won?
Yep, but TLC really stepped up in his absence
Go pack
Bucks and Sixers helping us out too, fewf
Doesn't LeBron have a much higher percentage on clutch shots? Feel like I read that somewhere or am I trippin
Sexland vs *Gormelo
I loved that match up. My eyes were glued on Allen. Love his defense
Ya, that was some clown shit by Allen for sure, just surprised something wasn't thrown Terry's way too
Except they won.
Hornets win! Hornets win! Hornets win!!!!!!!!!
he got 20 minutes and a lot of freedom. What more do you want for a 19 year old when he has two starting level guards in front of him?
He did also have 4 fouls and 3 turnovers in 20 minutes of play. Still, looking forward to him getting more comfortable and handling the point more as the season continues.
Hed be given freedom if he earned it in practice
You miss 100% of the shots you miss
Deadass no ones talking about it. If it was lebron it would be 10k upvoted rn
Don't mind this dude. His post history is nothing but negative comments when it comes to Kyrie.
Hayward is a poor-man's LeBron James.  Star, veteran, wing, who can score and facilitate and KNOWS HOW TO RUN A HALF-COURT OFFENSE!

There are very, very few players in the league with that specific set of skills.  This was a masterstroke signing by MJ.
All local broadcasters are biased but ever listen to a broadcast like the Celtics? It's absurd.
They're not too bad, but I couldnt with how they refer to themselves as the good guys. Felt like it's a disney movie lol. Regarding fouls though they were not very biased, pleasant to watch
They supposed to be lol, that's why it's local
something something the East runs through Cleveland
to be fair garland and sexton seem legit now
This is the real COVID-19 season. The bubble was just the start. This season is going to be wild.
Frankie Smokes became Frankie Flamethrower
[deleted]
Cleveland dont go no stars but we do got a bunch of solid players with amazing chemistry, might actually make the playoffs this year
I think we’re seeing the difference in fatigue levels of the teams that played in the playoffs, and the teams that didn’t, or missed the bubble entirely. The teams in the bubble that missed the playoffs have had 4 months off, and the teams that missed the bubble entirely have had 10 months of rest. I think this is gonna lead to a ton of upsets this year and some interesting surprise playoff teams.
At least with the Sixers it's expected since they are an average team this season. 

While the 76ers have added _some_ shooting, they lack volume scorers and this will haunt them this season.
Beast East
Tonight has been crazy, the Bucks score and the Sixers score made me think ESPN was fucking up the numbers.
TBF, the Lakers Clippers game was like a 4 point game when Lebron came out after rolling his ankle. Also, the Clippers only won by 6 when Lebron came out with 7 minutes left and AD came out with 3 minutes left. That could have easily gone the other way.
Balanced as all things should be
Just watched this yesterday and said it has to be the Knicks right when she was messing with a team and couldn't hold back laughter after the call. movie spoilers: >!and with 22 on earth now maybe the Knicks can turn it around!<
Hell yes just saw this. That call by Doris was legendary
Doesn't Lebron already own the Raptors?
Confusing as it always is
Man, as someone who doesn’t have a team and cheers for individual players, I hope you guys are competitive. MJ has brought me so much joy in my life that I want him to be successful as an owner, and as an extension you guys too! Viva MJ! Never leave us GOAT!
The secret is keeping Cody Zeller on IL for the rest of the season. PJ and Miles are boomin
Honestly outside of the center position y'all have a solid squad
They're just gonna wear GH out like they did Kemba. He'll be gassed by the end of the season, and all they'll have to show for it is a spot in the 8th seed play in game.
Throw your entire team on the table for Harden, then when he chucks a fit and wants to leave send him to the Hornets where he wins 3 rings in the best team he could hope to join.
Well that got awkward fast.
Bruh your username is funny as fuck
yes
OP said "that we could have gotten for a while" future tense. Not "we have gotten in a while" past tense.
Al Jefferson
Better than trading any assets for someone to eat the contract imo. Draft is the best way for Charlotte to improve
lmao, yeah they're hilarious.  it makes these games so much fun to watch.  It's so weird to say the Hornets are fun to watch, but they just ARE
Sometimes you get hot in a small sample size  early in your career and it gets you paid.
He's getting depressed from waiting for his invite to Smash Bros.
He was a late-round pick who was thrusted onto high expectations. 

He definitely has regressed terribly, but I think it's a confidence thing. Dude is playing next to NBA Champions all the time, and it just seems like he tries too hard to compensate. Big thing seemed to happen when he was on the Clippers too.
If only we still had Stephanie
Me too. Although to be fair, he seems to be excited a lot of the time. I love his passion for Hornets basketball.
Clippers just looked straight up terrible
We should be findig out today
For sure , I get it now, i should've picked that up by now
lol
Funny but NC purple af
Wait isn't the Gov of NC a Democrat? lol
Lmfao
This just is not funny.
They literally just beat us last night
Lol you were also in meltdown mode (as was I)
Cavs yes.  OKC no..  They were awful that game too, we just went 3/24 in a quarter.  Like damn dude you shouldn't beat anyone playing like that.
I think the Cavs really are good this year.  idk about OKC.
Yeah a lot to be excited about in Cleveland. I could've seen Sexton making this type of leap into year 3 but Garland coming out this hot is a great sign for them. Excited to see how they look once KPJ is back.
Hornets win a Playoff series
LaMelo wins ROTY
MJ comes out of retirement because he took it personally
I think this season is gonna be the turning point where LBJ will start to actually be seen as the GOAT, especially if the lakers win it all. If he goes out next season and keeps being the lebron we all know and love then I can't see an argument for him not being the GOAT.
Him adding that mid range floater was the only thing he needed to be a starter caliber player. I don’t know why he didn’t do it in Boston but I’m glad to see he’s still growing.
Jay Hernandez is gonna unlock Terry
Get on the train
It's almost like us with the LaMelo stans, except, they have 2 legit top 10 players instead of a 19yo kid
LeBron has like double the percentage on clutch shots as KD/Steph/Kyrie.  He's over 50% while those guys are in the low 30's
the refs made the right call by not rewarding Allen's antics.  It should honestly be a Tech on the player who tried to do possibly the most disrespectful move in the game.
? And your point is... am I supposed to say they’re not ass for being pushed to their limit by the bulls. Wouldn’t have been an upset
Not getting benched every time he makes a few mistakes. How else do you learn?
Its called being a rookie. You don’t come in an all star unless you’re LBJ or Tim Duncan.
Top 3 pick doesn’t earn minutes in practice. You had top 3 pick for a reason. Yall delusional af. No GM drafts that high to watch the guy ride the pine.
Big if true
It just shows you the gap from Bron to everyone else. We all sweat every move Bron makes
The nets broadcasters are kinda unbiased from what I've seen, at least the play by play guy - RJ is pretty damn funny most of the time so he gets a pass on any bias. The knicks are very unbiased IMO but thats because they are used to having to tell it like it is. Clyde straight up called out the city jerseys as ugly during the broadcast the other day.
RIP Tommy Heinsohn
Forget the celtics man, have u ever heard cleveland casters espescially during lebrons last stint there... I couldnt watch it with commentary so i watched the games on mute
The Celtics have been like that historically though so they should keep it as part of their brand.
Celtics by far the worst
Can't even disagree with this, Tommy was the biggest Celtics homer on the planet.
Celtics are the worst
Stop hatin on a dead man
I find that the Kings keep it real.
They give the benefit of the doubt to Hornets, but they basically call it as they see it. I had them on today and was thinking they were a good crew.
Tristan Thompson sends his regards.
The East runs through the newly renovated Moynihan Station.
In all seriousness the Cavs actually have some upside
puts some respek on SexLand
Drummond
Sexton always fucks us feels like.  Dude is quick and can dribble drive with the best of em
I think you might be right. I get the feeling there might be several teams that are huge surprises this year.
Kawhi doesn't play for the Bucks, though.
Bucks, Nets, Sixers, and Celtics lost today.  Made out shitty loss feel a little better.
I thought I was safe in this thread... :(
MJ isn't playing checkers. He's playing... Well, something else
I like your team. Mostly because Borrego seems like a really good coach. I’ve seen a couple hornets games, and you guys move the ball extremely well.
Dang bro you a hater much? We didn’t wear Kemba out, he fought his tail off for this franchise and we knew we couldn’t keep him. He didn’t play a lot injured or anything. Not sure what you’re talking about.
Harden on the Hornets prob won’t win a chip but wouldn’t go down easily in a playoff series. This team has a lot of borderline all star talent and role players that fit nice with Harden
Lol thank you, I got down voted but it was a genuine question
Playing behing JJ with Embiid probably helped.
Or gets Tobias Harris paid
She was incredible. What a knowledgeable trio that was.
They looked pretty damn unstoppable against Lakers and Nuggets tho.
U should be ashamed
But state still went red in the general election
Yes it is
Yea Garland looks solid.

I think KPJ needs to get his life in order and really ground himself before even worrying about ball.
That’ll drain me dry
dude...  if the Hornets win a Playoff series basketball will never be the same again
Well, Edwards will be MLS MVP or wins a Grammy and Wiseman is on the Warriors so will get injured in like 10 games tops so yeah, LaMelo will be Roty
ok relax I think the no-call was fine lmao
Any team with a healthy Steph Curry is a playoff team. Definitely not as ass as the Bulls are, and have been, for most of the last decade.
Just saying I don't think he's quite ready for more minutes yet
Its not about minutes. It's about role. They arent going to let him chuck up shots inefficiently because he is a top 3 pick. They are still trying to win games. If he wants more freedom he has to show off the court that he is capable of handling that freedom
We got a top 3 pick because we jumped up like eight picks in the lottery?
It'll never be the same without him! Scal is pretty fun too, though.
Growing up I never understood why my dad muted NBA games sometimes. Now I get it lol
I literally have no idea what you are talking about
Agreed. Pistons crew seemed good vs Cavs last night too. They were really singing praise to Sexton, Garland, and Cedi. Refreshing to see
Defending champs
Contract year
Said he wants to be DPOY this year
Can it be the Kings for once? thx
Ahem
Haha yea 100%.

My delusional homer ass: "Only good teams lost today, just one of those weird NBA nights"
The clippers don’t even deserve to be on that list, they lost so bad
When LeBron is done you have to deal with Bronny next. The James family will dominate the Raptors for generations. You got that ring though. Worth.
Poor Raptors catchin strays
MJ Playing 5-D Canasta
Hes smoking cigars
The ceiling is the roof
MJ heard that...and he took it personally.
Hornets sub still to this day can't decide if they like Borrego or not. He's enough of an improvement over Clifford he's got my stamp of approval, for whatever that's worth
Did you watch the games? He'd have to drop 40 every night just to keep it close, and they'd still lose half of those. Maybe some of their recent draft picks will give GH some help. But if not, he's gonna be in the same place as Kemba was.
[deleted]
Is the state going to be purple or is it already? The last few elections have been down to the wire there
Ah shit honestly totally forgot what was going on with him lol I was thinking he was just injured.
So then people shouldn’t scream triple single if the guy lacks opportunities to do more at the moment.
He was not chucking up dumb shots today or last game.
So you were a lottery team correct? Are you now a serious playoff contender or a playoff lock? I’m thinking that’s a no.
I was 14 when lebron went back to cleveland and got into basket(from germany) and i started muting the announcers about 2 games in/tried to get german commentary. I would even mute highlight on youtube when i watched em on yt
The announcer who everyone always hated on for being biased is a Celtics legend, as a player, coach and announcer, and he died in November.
This is literally like if someone said "i hate those Lakers players, always playing shooting guard and wearing both numbers 8 and 24" in February 2020 and then playing dumb. You're clearly referring to Tommy, who literally just died. Have some class.
Evidently
Haha. Maybe. I am a Mavs fan, but I watch Sac quite a bit. They look good. Nice, deep rotation. Ultimately, the King's ceiling might depend on Bagley's growth as a player.
What if we draft Bronny? does that break the curse?
5D tic tac toe
Partagas Lusatanias and pre Castro Cubans! His Cigar Afficianado interview is well worth watching on YouTube.
He's smoking 4D cigars
That’s the same as Wolves w Saunders. I personally think he’s better as an assistant or Player Development guy but to each their own
bro that game literally broke records, i think it deserves the attention its getting
After 2012 NC was expected to be more purple than it has the past two cycles. NC and VA use to be pretty similar politically, but VA has shifted harder and quicker. GA going blue while NC was red was also odd.

But yeah I’d still classify it as a swing state
It's crazy, he's super talented and young, completely healthy, but cant see the floor on a young Cavs team because of "personal problems" (that's why he's listed out for games).
Exactly, probably because the coach is having him take smart open shots only
No but don't act like we were so abysmal that we should throw a very raw rookie out for 30+ minutes a night over multiple starter-quality guards. Dumb take.
Oh sorry that sucks. No I don't care enough about broadcasters to learn their names. Just know they are huge homers whenever I listened.
That's 100% what its on. Well that and Luke as a coach...

And I don't like those odds lol
Nah he'll just turn out to be a bust and y'all will suck
Even though the infinite multiverse itself has infinite variations there isn't one in existence where the James family doesn't dominate the Raptors, sorry. :(
you dont have to, Bronny will end up undrafted and signed.
Isnt it just like evrywhere else,  urban areas vote blue and the farmers/people living in the countryside vote red?
Then why people need to clown him like he’s given Trae Youngs leash and doing nothing with it? He’s expected to play like a vet 3 games in with a short ass leash. Why expect big numbers in that situation?
Its not a dumb take. He doesn’t need 30+ but 15 is not acceptable. The whole point is to become a contender and hope for a window to win it all. You either take the next step by signing a star or drafting one. If you get a number 3 thats high star potential. You need to play him to know if you got a star. You give 15 mins to a number 26 pick not the 3. Otherwise you trade it for value.
Well you're ignorant
Well, shit.
Yes, but NC is also one of the most heavily gerrymandered states so there are pockets of blue voters that often don’t bother voting they’re so outnumbered in their district.
Because people are reactionary and like to spend their time shitting on 20 year olds
I think the happy medium is between what both of you are saying. We are not a playoff team and Melo should be playing more. But also, it's game 3. His minutes have increased with each game. The adjustment period may take a few weeks, but he is headed for starter's minutes as he continues to learn and get better. This is a 19 year old who had no training camp. I don't think it's crazy for a coach to try to look out for him and ease him into a rotation that has plenty of room for a third guard, but where we already have two solid players.
Alright bud
I can agree with that. As long this doesn’t turn into Larry Brown destroying Darco to chase championships.
