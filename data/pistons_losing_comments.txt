Quality tank job by detroit. I'm sorry we scared you for a second. Hope you get the draft pick you desire.
The most clutch tank I've ever witnessed live. Thank you Pistons! 🤝
I watched the last 5 minutes and that was an incredible tank job by Detroit.  Absolutely brilliant.
this victory required a huge combined effort by the clippers to win and the pistons to lose. sending my energy to detroit to get them cade, they deserve him after this one
MAN OH **MANN**
"Nobody cared who I was before I put on the ~~mask~~ goggles " - Reggie Jackson probably
   
Edit
Clippers Pistons is the most friendly rivalry ever
Somebody in this subreddit was ready to gild the PGT if we lost.
When the Clippers get the W, I get a little chubby dude!!!!!!!!!
I was getting worried that the Pistons forgot how to tank.
REGGIE

FUCKIN

JACKSON
This years Clippers feel idk different. Like they have a story, humility, better chemistry etc
Hot damn Reggie “goggles” Jackson
Such an ugly win lol
These two clips vs pistons games have been some of the most amusing games of the season
Absolutely amazing comeback. I don't think I have enjoyed a game of basketball so much this season...even though it hurt us
Chubby dude where you at??
Elite tank job. Wtf was that
God tier tank job in that last 30 seconds
Happy for reggie. He was getting flamed in our game thread earlier lol
Rockets say fuck you Detroit
Godammit.. Bey is gonna be really good isn’t he?

🍀🔫
The Pistons were up by 5 with 45 seconds left against the Clippers and lost in regulation by giving up a bucket, turning the ball over, giving another bucket, turning the ball over again, and giving up one last bucket. Absolutely elite tank job.
Win win game. GG Pistons!
Elite Tanking
Reggie on a minimum deal and has been playing so good for the clips this season. Wow
*AGGRESIVE SHMONEYING*
First time I've ever seen a tank in real life.
love you reggie
LFG Reggie thought we were gonna win there
That shot was the most Reggie Jackson ever contributed to the Pistons success
Action Jackson
Clippers were down 98-93 with about 45 seconds left
Exceptional tank job
Fucking how. that gotta be an all time tank job
Yay!!!
GLASSES JACKSON
I still love Reggie and I'm glad to know he still loves Detroit and calls it his home.
REGGIEEEEEEEEEEE
Reggie still has some love for Detroit I see
Reggie made Kawhi happy
REGGIE
Isiah Thomas in shambles on NBA TV right now
Got $100 million of contracts sitting on the bench watching our team with the ball with the chance to win the game  but that's ok. We got Reggie Jackson
Yeah they tanking but the players can't feel good about this. What a choke job by Detroit.
[deleted]
Imo they should be seen as the favorites right now but I know they won't because people still have that catastrophic chokejob in the back of their minds. I have a hard time seeing Kawhi choke in back to back playoffs just cos he's been a great playoff performer his entire career. They have a great shot at redemption this year for sure
Reggie was on point last night
I dont even watch basketball and im 100% confident at least half the teams in march madness would beat this pistons team. I would rather let crows pick my fucking eyes out peck by peck than ever watch mason plumlee again lmfao.
Lol Detroit is so fuckin awful
I was about to go on an anti-Clippers rant if we won that
Thanks Pistons west
Everybody wins!!
We won't, unfortunately
No problem all hail the tank
I legitimately thought at one point on the last possession that we almost got the “call a time out with no time outs” tech free throw.
Subscribed to Onlymanns
*the goggles
Same color scheme and animosity with the Lakers.
Dont lie, this ain’t no little chubby
#**THERE**
reggie jackson just snatched ur chubby from the jaws of despair
At which hour the clippers receiveth the w, i receiveth a dram chubby broth'r
Reggie Jackson is the greatest point guard of all time
We did it fam!!!
Been waiting for this
there it is
Yesssssirr
Make sure to name this one Reggie in honor of our 🐐
Is it there?
Vet minimum contract btw
There was one year when he was one of the best clutch scorers in the league. Glad he's found a role with you guys
Goggles Jaxs
His name is Bobby get it right
ACTION JACKSON
Knowing Reggie he’ll probably go ice cold next week and play terrible
You can thank Doc being gone.
I mean, my biggest take away from last season was that our team just quit. Like over and over again. We felt like a team of just punch card guys. 

This team doesn’t feel that way. Whatever team chemistry is, we actually have it this year.
I'm so nervous because I've had the "this team feels different" feeling just last year and before that with the 2015 team and we know how those ended up. 

But fuck man this squad really does feel different. We got back our never quit mentality from 2019, but with a bunch of high IQ vets and two star guys playing some of the best ball of their careers. And getting contributions from 1-12 down the roster. 

I hate this hopeful feeling man it just makes me anxious lol
this year we have an identity
Humility? Have you played them recently?
Ugly and great at the same time
For a tanking team, we’re surprisingly so competitive & entertaining every single game. It’s a team full of young inexperienced guys tho, and that inexperience reflects our record.
I'm all up in here
I felt like that was blatant throwing but I'm not complaining lmao
Gotta get that Cade percentage up
Detroit say fuck you too!
Hold up a Boston fan being jealous at us for something? lmao
Hinkie in tears right now watching the Pistons play.
no doubt Weaver probably ordered it and Casey executed the plan perfectly.
Bruh we’ve had L’s like this every week the players will be fine
You mean everything they could've done right, they did? 

You're either committed to the tankathon or you're not.
and the pistons won too so what's the issue?
Youre wrong, you're dumb, and quite frankly I'm ashamed of you
It's called a tank
Let's at least get to the end of this regular season before you start shitting on teams, you were there not so long ago yourselves.
*no lies here
suicide burn. i like it.
This is the one
Doesn't everyone hate the Lakers though? It's kinda like Duke
Yeah, i am fully torqued
#IT
There it is!!
I can't even think of any other point guards
Way ahead of you
I'm so thankful for him. He's almost definitely played himself out of our price range for next year but he's been enormous this season
That season made it so I could never hate him
Nah he’s been solid as hell as our starting PG while Pat Bevs been gone
There were too many guys like Trez too. There are just way more mature/leaders on this team.
That’s what I’ve been thinking. Last year they gave up big leads and quit but this year they still give up big leads but actually fight to get them back.
The team just cares this year. Games like this, the Atlanta comeback, etc.
that 2019 team. good times
Last years Clippers were just cocky and it showed on the pitch. They played like year 3 of a dynasty. They seem more focused this season. Could be better leadership from coaching
I don’t wanna hear that while y’all have Devin “I’ll talk shit while getting help from the refs and banged on by PG” Booker
Nah man you guys are just on another level of salty this year
Doesn't even feel possible with how bad the Rockets are but this was a good effort
Yea no shit lol
It’s the internet bro. I don’t need to be super friendly for upvotes lol. Saying Detroit is bad isn’t talking trash, I’m just stating the obvious
Yo sounds dumb but why u guys can hv the team name under ur username?
Laker fans are typically eternally surprised to hear that everyone hates them, and there are a ton in this subreddit
Not by Uncle Ron, I hope?
#IS
IS
Tis hither
Name a point guard for a dollar. Name a point guard!!!! Name a point guard!!!!
PG is his sugar daddy. He’s not going anywhere.
Reggie's been so good that I was surprised that he had a bad game against the pacers. Shockingly consistent
yup, literally every team gives up big leads, that's the nature of the NBA. it's what you do in response that matters
Remember when Book hit a game winner on PG and Kawhi at the same time? That was nice.
Fair. Gotta make up for the last decade
as long as you have a bottom 3 record you'll have the same chance as them
Gottem
We’re a bunch of kids and Jerami Grant. So.. have at it. Good game Clips. Definitely hope you shit on the Suns now in the playoffs.
Uncle Reggie baby
Reggie Jackson
Jackie Chan
The truth is he was like this in Detroit until his knee problems flaired up. Unfortunately there is a vocal minority of Detroit sports fans that are always bitter and only view negatives. One of the worst groups of fans in sports.
But it was more than that though, it was that, as a team, clocking in and clocking out is really the best way to describe it. Like, kawhi would be doing what he can, and really was still an insane player, but we’d clock out.

Not to blame it all on doc at all, but It was never more obvious to me that doc rivers doesn’t hold practices.
How far into the playoffs did that shot get him?
And he hasn’t done shit in the two games since. Meanwhile PG and Kawhi have rawdogged y’all
That was shockingly reasonable for a conversation about salt on this sub
I just don’t like the idea of potentially dropping to pick 7 if we end up with a better record than Houston and Minnesota. Ideally I want to at least have a top 5 pick.
I'm convinced a Detroit team winning a lottery is 0% no matter how much they lose
You want me to say Detroit is good? I have no hate towards the pistons, and respect their fans for sticking with them. But their current state is a dumpster fire, losing to the clips with half their roster out, on the road, on a second night of a back to back isn’t good
Understandable
Just about as far as you guys made it.
We’ll keep looking down at y’all in the standings and you can keep holding on to those games bud:) 

And I’m the salty one sheesh
I was shocked. I didn’t know how to respond.
We’re in line for a top 5 pick, have a bunch of good young players, and a budding star in Jerami Grant.  We aren’t supposed to be good right now. 

I’ve seen my team win 3 titles in my lifetime, how many have you seen the Suns win..
Not making the playoffs is the same as a 7 game series in the second round?
Take the L dude, you spouting bs
losing in the second round in 7 games = not making the playoffs. now i can see how you deal with losing
How did you already fall so far?! I’m dissapointed in you

Honestly tho, it’s fun catharsis to be salty on Reddit so I ain’t mad at it
Yes, you are coming off as extremely salty since you started this comment chain by being salty lol. It’s not that hard to understand
Clearly said their “current state” is not good so I don’t get the point of bringing up past achievements or bringing my team into it. But congrats on those 3 rings, I hope my suns can join them at some point
The copium helps too
And what good did it do for them? Doesn’t mean a thing without a championship. There’s one winner and 29 losers in the NBA every year.
I’m just talking shit on Reddit :) at the end of the day it’s not like I actually feel how I say I do on here. Just fun to talk shit. 

Same reason I don’t get upset when people say things about the Suns. It’s just Reddit
are the 1999 knicks not impressive for making the finals as an 8th seed? this is a very fucking shitty argument. we shouldn't care about anything aside from who wins the championship i guess. the 8-0 bubble suns doesn't show anything since they didnt win the championship
Won’t lie, I got banned on here after our game against y’all, lol. 

Was more pissed at the refs than y’all if I’m being real tho.
Yeah pretty much honestly. Nobody talks about the 1999 Knicks, they talk about the Spurs. Nobody talks about the 2002 Nets, the 2007 Cavs, the 2010 Celtics. They talk about the Lakers and Spurs because they won it all. 

29 losers and 1 winner every season. If you don’t end up on top, you lost.
I feel it. I don’t have any I’ll will towards the Clippers at all. At the end of the day, it’s fuck the Lakers and that’s that.
I have a policy of rooting for every team without a ring when I can. Fuck everyone who does tho.
Still undefeated in the Gordon era
No Bol Bol minutes so this is a spiritual loss for my Nuggets
MPJ was phenomenal tonight
Denver is scoring at a 135 pt per 100 possession clip since the trade. Just phenomonal.
Undefeated in the gordon era
Jokic doing his best Zion impression with that 13/16 shooting
Seeing MPJ grow into a consistent scorer has been amazing to watch
27/8/11 on 13/16 shooting in under 27 minutes. Another MVP quality game from Jokic
did mpj really have 27 with 4 dribbles?
Jokic got two free throws!!
Still undefeated in the AG era!
Pistons played as well as they possibly could and still got smashed. They just ran into a much better team.
Winners:

Our seeding.
Pistons tank keeps chugging along. 
Grant balling out good for him man best wishes. 
Bench unit playing well tgt.

Losers:
Barton haters. Seriously, he's a flawed player but when he starts, he spaces the floor, can b a secondary playmaker, knows our plays well, and allows us to play a switchable defense. Monte can't guard bigger wings, and dozier is well... Dozier. Defense is our biggest weakness and Barton rounding out the main 4 core is currently the best solution. The starting 5 have had our best defense in forever and Barton is part of that equation.
Holy hell, that was probably the worst ass kicking we've had all year. The thing is we didn't play that badly for the first 2/3 of it. It was like a B- game for us at that point. It was just an A+++ game from the Nuggets.
Trolling aside. Its so great to see Jokic put these numbers up in just 3 quarters with 2 free throws.  Got rest for our game tomorrow & continues winning while putting up great stats for that MVP chase.
Jokic just toyed with the Pistons, completely dominant
Wheels fell off for Detroit when Grant sat

Not many bench units out there bad enough to make ours look good
mods deleted both Jokic stepback threads.
Jokic will probably win the MVP with the lowest FTs per game average in NBA history for an MVP. Now thats disrespect.
2 free throws for Jokic tonight, meanwhile Embiid had 20 against the Celtics.....
so happy to have fans tonight, go nuggets. Jokic easy MVP
Jokic would have had 40/11/15 if he played his usual 35 minutes.
I think Stewart deserves more non garbage time minutes, what do Pistons fans think?
Denver usually lose a lot of games when the opposition teams shoot 43%+ from 3, now we blowing them out despite that
Saddiq Bey almost with the Bojan special. 25 points, one assist, nothing else.
MVP played well tonight.
Jokic shot 81% in 26 mins lol..missed TD by 2x rebounds. If he really played could have dropped 60 with TD today ,shame
GG
Ive been meaning to ask, why isnt Javale McGee playing yet?
50 games in he is the clear cut MVP. So versatile and picks apart a defense, and make his teammates easy open looks
Nuggets commentary was a pretty brutal listen honestly. Grateful that I usually get to listen to Blaha and Kelser.

Denver looked excellent though of course, Gordon looks like a nice add there.
Anyone have a link to the Monte dunk?
This wasn't really a blow out but yay for the tank
Jokic’s FT’s were the difference
After the crowd was chanting for it...Malone hates fans? /s
Straight up DNP for Bol Bol
At least we got to see future Nuggets legend Gary “Gary “Gary Harris” Harris” Clark
Why is hes freezing McGee tho. Cant believe he will be happy with that
Offensively, defensively he was giving way too much space to Bey who murdered us from behind the arc.  Didn't matter in this game of course, but against a better team leaving the shooters wide open all night is going to hurt us.  

I'll give him a pass since he was taking it a little easy on the defensive end in a blowout on the first night of a back to back though.
like every night for a long time this season. guy’s making Klay’s absence feel less bad.
What. That's incomprehensible.
Prior to the trade we'd led by 20 or more at half time 8 times in the past 3 years. We've done it 3 times in the past 8 days.
We may never lose again lol
Went to the line only 3 times as well. Could have easily gone for 30+ in his limited minutes
yeah, i don't want to live in a world where anyone but Jokić is crowned MVP
6'10 very athletic wing + 7'0 passing genius = buckets
He wasn't talking about this game but I believe against the sixers last week, yes 27 points on 4 dribbles.
I’d be surprised. I remember him doing as little iso through the legs into a cross. But, he didn’t have a lot.
Yea..He usually gets none...
We lost because Denver is much better, but 2nd night on a back-to-back did us no favors.
Additional minor win: Jokic playing under 30 minutes on the first night of a back to back
Had to add Pistons fans to the losers for having to watch 20+ minutes of CoJo
Barton has some horrible shooting nights but still when he's on the court good things tend to happen
This was the best Barton game in a while. Happy for him, just hope he keeps the consistency up.
That's okay, I'll that the L and sleep well tonight with the Nuggets win.

Will The Thrill: Great role player, catch and shoot, able to help run the offense, solid defense.

Billy Barton: Misses easy layups, rookie mistakes, constant turnovers, tunnel vision, ball hog.

We got Will The Thrill tonight.
I honestly thought grant was going to carry you guys the entire game the way he started
I can’t watch them - was this game more of a thrashing than the game against the Knicks on Saturday?
Our bench unit isn’t even that bad, it’s top of the league in scoring. But our recent addition CoJo is an absolute mess I must say so.
[deleted]
absolutely, but b2b and we rest Plumlee vs OKC just to him played today (The worst player in the court today)

so Stew got some rest
27 minutes is a lot for this team.  Our box scores usually look like preseason games with eleven guys playing between 15 and 22 minutes.
He's been my favorite rookie out of our 4. He just fucking bangs with dudes. Gets beat by length around the paint, but he bodies people up/ gets under their skin. On offense he spaces the floor with his midrange game and can occasionally shoot 3s.

We got an old school PF/C with some modern skills. I project him to be our starter for the future.
I don’t know if he ever dribbled or was ever covered
He forgot to miss a few shots and get the tip in rebounds, instead just made them the first time, what a dork
We’re paying Green to much to give him DNPs?
I loved it when Marlowe asked Hastings what he thought the prospects were for the Pistons future and he paused for like 10 seconds and just said that he didn’t want to think about it.
I listened to the Pistons announcers and I gotta say, what a treat. They were so fair and praised the Nuggets, specifically Jokic.
They call jokic the splendid serbian now
Marlowe is OK, but Hastings is a hard listen more often than not. IMHO it's much better with Katy Winge slotting in at the color commentator spot.
Old man hastings is really fucking negative.
Your commentators, TWICE in the first quarter, said "Denver chose not to retain jerami grant"... gimme a break. Called MPJ Campazzo. Few other weird things too.

I did like yours for the most part but that's pretty ridiculous
Yup, they are biased lmao.
Yeah they're comically bad. I just find myself laughing at it more often than not

Cheers for the props. You guys fought the good fight but were just outmatched.
[Nuggets twitter](https://twitter.com/nuggets/status/1379603724511813638?s=19)
Excuse me. Denver played mostly the bench and even the end of the bench in the entire 4th period. When you know you going to win smart coaches play there bench to give them practice time. The difference between a 30 point win and 16 point win is absolutely nothing. YOu where soundly beaten when it actually mattered. Garbage points don't mean much.
We pulled all the starters for the fourth. It wasn't as close as the score indicates
Bro it was 100% a blowout lol. We were completely outmatched. Nuggets fans were cheering to play Bol Bol at the start of the fourth.
We were up 26 before garbage time.
If he had gotten same free throws as embiid he actually have 47 points lol
Malone was pissed at the defense in the post game. So no way he was gonna put Bol in.
I don't think this is the night to really criticize the defense. I feel like the last 4 minutes of D with the 3rd bench unit out there really made this game feel a lot closer than it actually was.

There was a stat at one point in the game Bey and Grant had like 24 points each and the rest of the team had 29 total. If that's how we play against other teams starters I will take it.
The Murray/Barton/Gordon/MPJ/Jokic lineup has played 90 minutes together and are + 61. That’s not terrible...
We know how to put the ball in the bucket. Just gotta stop other teams from doing it now.
This but unironically
Cheeseburgers.
Thats the joke pal
He blows alot of lay ups, does hero ball stuff at times (but usually sub 10secs in the shot clock), and is caught napping on defense. If we had a healthy Harris we would probably play him over Barton. But Barton is our best starting option and ppl who say bench him aren't thinking of who we are putting in his place and how it affects our defense.
My standards for Barton are for how good is the 5th best player on the team. Simply due to how the salary cap they are going to be limited and flawed, if not they wouldn't be paid low enough to be on it. As far as 5th options go Barton has alot of upside, and on a good day he can be the difference in a win or loss. That's enough for me at least
I thought we played better at the start. Like it was a game that might've developed into a win vs some teams. But we were still down double digits and then halfway in the third it went completely off the rails and we stopped giving effort.

But it wasn't like a 0 effort game from start to finish.
watch the games. Not saying he deserves 20 but definitely more than 2
If you think the differences are drastic enough to explain THAT disparity, then you just proved you don't actually watch jokic play, ever. 

Embiid earned his FTs tonight. Jokic earned probably 10+ and got 2. Just on highlights posted in r/nba right now he gets fouled on like all of them, with no call.
He got majority of that in the second half tho, would’ve been nice to see him play more vs the other teams starters
Hastings was known here in Detroit for being one of the Bad Boys that’s only job was to take care of the wives 

Guy averaged 1 point per game for us
They’re awesome man. Blaha has been commentating our games since the 70s. They always give the opponent their full due.
That comes from when Jokic hit a good hook shot and Marlowe said "a splendid Serbian hooker..... shot."
katy is amazing she knows baksetball, and has really insightful comments on the plays that Malone runs and how the Nuggets both excel and why they mess up
I really hope Katy replaces Hastings sometime soon. She’s gonna get a better job somewhere else if not and it would be a mistake to lose her.
Fuck no Hastings is so much better
fuck the refs
Nuggets - play like shit

Hastings: "they're playing like shit"

oMg He's So NeGaTivE!!!
Much obliged!
Yea I understand that lol
Fair I did tab out after the 3rd and it was pretty decisive at that point but im just now checking the final score, the beginning was pretty competitive though and fun to watch
The second half
Love both players but the calls embiid gets, Jokic should also be getting
Embiid deserves his free throws
He just likes to be angry so the team doesnt get too high. When the team is tight he gets looser to balance it. He is a weird coach but I think it kinda works
I feel like you're misconstruing things here. Yes, Bey/Grant had the majority of the points for the Pistons, but they did that on good efficiency *and* the rest of the roster shot reasonably well throughout the game. The reason those two were scoring is 'cause the Nuggets couldn't guard them for their lives, not because they were forced into hero ball. 55/44/80 are not acceptable shooting splits for a defense to give up, even if your offense is churning, Malone was right to be frustrated. The reason that the rest of the Pistons had so few points is because y'all won the rebounding battle super hard tonight, which is the one positive takeaway for the defense. Other than that it was pretty frustrating to watch though
MPJ left Bey wiiiiiiiiiiide open at least half a dozen times in the first half.  It was legitimately ridiculous.
That's atrocious. Can't even get to +70 smh basically non competitive scrubs
Barton makes loud mistakes, but not frequent mistakes.
"If we had a healthy Harris"

This tune has been playing for 4 years now bub. Give it a rest.
For that to work he needs to have the usage like he's 4th or 5th option, problem is that's not always the case.
[deleted]
he banged with the starters most of the first quarter...
I agree but, I think it’s good for his development. His minutes are slowly and slowly increasing. I think Casey’s just trying to iron out his rookie mistakes before giving him the keys
She's also up to date with the meme game. HOF announcer imo
I'll take Hastings over her 100 times out of 100
I think Scott may retire after this season, he is reportedly pretty over the traveling
I mean I'm not convinced you do
Yes he does, jokic does too.
Embiid gets too many, but it is within the rules of the game currently. Trae and Harden get too many too. The NBA rewards foul baiting too much and Embiid (rightfully) takes advantage
no one said he didn't
I guess when the game is like 30 points wide open at half-time I'm not too concerned about it. 

TBH this game really seemed like a defensive anomaly in the Gordon era so far. Pistons had 86 points after 3 quarters. They would then go on to score the most points of any quarter for them in that game in the 4th quarter as the Nuggets sat their starters. I get that Grant and Bey were great, but as far as things go, I wouldn't be too worried about the Nuggets. Grant is showing out to be a top 20 player this year. He's gonna get his.
rotation responsibilites are not always obvious. not all were on MPJ
This is absolutely the truth. And some mistakes are more minor but looks worse than they are (driving the rim and having it knocked out or not finishing the shot, but it being the right decision).

Out of 75 possessions a game he makes the right one 65-70 times. More than most. The offense just flows better when he is on the floor.
I guess if I had to choose I would go with loud mistakes, but often times his mistakes come at the WORST possible moment.

I was happy to see him pull up on a fast break when he didn't have a lane and just wait for the rest of the team. I wish he would do that more often.
U realise he's off the team right? We traded for AG?
dude literally has the 5th highest usage rate on the team
Teams are going to dare him to make plays by putting the worst defensive option on him. His shot numbers are about where they are supposed to be.
Lol he is 4th in fga, 4th in scoring, 4th in assists, and 5th on usage. So yes, that is usually the case...
Just comparing the 2 most dominant centres in the league this season. Why wouldn’t people compare them?
I got downvoted a ton for saying the same thing. Embiid is just hated
Had 10 mins in the first half, almost 18 in the second half.
facts she brought the munder from reddit to mainstream nuggets media forever goated for that
This is the correct take.
Yes
My bad. I thought he was implying Embiid deserves less fts
most of them were
I just don't get what people want. Over the last 3 seasons, our offense has been one of the best in the league, and arguably *the* best given that the other best teams each year have been different. Barton has been a part of all our top lineups, like almost every single one. Is he the weakest starter? Sure. But someone has to be in a lineup full of good players lol
You realize how quotes work? 

That was my exact sentiment my dude. He hasn't been healthy for years and now he's even gone and people are stiiiiiilll saying this exact phrase on repeat. It's crazy.
Ya people very weirdly cling to the ball hog / high usage trope with Barton when it hasn't been that way since he was a 6th man.
The nuggets also like to play through him early to get defenses focusing in on stopping his action, which once they do leaves one of MPJ or Murray or jokic in advantageous 1on1 matchups.
True
sure
Spurs winning to break the Rockets 8-year postseason streak. That's a double win for the Spurs.
spurs trying really hard to be .500; nothing more, nothing less.
We're now 9th in the conference which means we have home court advantage for our play in game......oh no
Derrick White.
Did we just?

a) Sweep a team

b) Win at home

c) Win the second leg of a back to back
2020 Lions: 5-11

2021 Redwings: 17-25-7

2021 Tigers: 7-12

2021 Pistons: 18-42

I’m so sorry Detroit sports fans
I’m just here to simp for Dejounte Murray. That rest tho 😤
I've never seen Bates Diop play before tonight, was impressed
Spurs are a much stronger team now that Quinndary Weatherspoon is in the rotation
Can you guys just stop winning please. Who is even on your team ? How do you keep winning. Damn pop...
Dam u Detroit
I hope Derrick averages 17 field goals a game for the rest of his career.
I wonder if Jerami Grant still thinks it was a good move.
Tre Jones is looking kind of rough. He feels really small. Has good defense on smaller guys and can occasionally drive, but he just doesn't seem like he offers much as a PG. Obviously a rookie so I'm not going to judge him too hard. But without a 3pt shot, it feels like he's just a worse version of a number of the other Spurs guards at the moment.
Biggest win all season. If we don't have the longest playoff streak then nobody in Texas will
perfectly balanced, as all things should be
Gotta get to 8 so we can play on the road.
Counterpoint: Jakob Poeltl
d) it’s the Pistons
pistons fans are actually excited. instead of chasing an 8th seed we're chasing Cade Cunningham and have at least 2 good rookies.
Do it this way it looks sadder:

2020 Lions: 5-11

2020 Red Wings: 17-49-5

2020 Tigers: 23-35

2021 Pistons: 18-42
The moral support was key for the team
*banned from Twitch*
That single steal changed the face of the game   
/s
Human Victory Cigar for a reason
We tried our best to stop and who's even on your team? JTA and friends?
Absolutely, he'll be better off for it in the long-term as he has evolved his game. With the Nuggets he wouldn't be averaging 23. He's still got plenty of time to go for a ring, but once his pistons contract is up he'll be able to contribute to a contender as a viable 2nd or 3rd option rather than being a solid role player
Did we watch the same game? He looked great tonight
He's a 2nd round pick in his 1st season - and hasnt had the year round G-League experience that would normally be available. The scouting report on him is that he would be a great back-court defender (at least for small PG's) but will have struggles offensively - and I think that's fair right now.

At worst he can be the 9-12th guy off the bench to provide backcourt defense whilst being a secondary playmaker (would work well with someone like Lonnie at the 2). But if he can improve that offensive game - which I don't think necessarily needs a 3pt shot, but more aggresive playmaking - then he can push himself up the rotation in the next couple of yeara.
Didn't watch this game, but what exactly were your expectations?  The guy was drafted #41.
I love the Texas NBA rivalry.
is Pop Thanos in this scenario?
We're half a game away from #8 funny enough. A Memphis loss + beating the Pels puts us as the 8th seed
Hmm when you out it that way...
Fuck purgatory this is the right call

I believe the Lions can turn it around too
&#x200B;

63 -137
Quinndary Weatherspoon ??? Is that a real person ?
What did you think he did well? I don't think any of his assists looked particularly hard to do. He offers no spacing at the guard position and barely even tried to score. Basically every time he was on court the Pistons went on a run. I think he's good at taking care of the ball, but I felt like we just couldn't score when he was running the offense.
Yeah he's a mid second rounder. I don't expect much of anything from him so if he can be a good third stringer or slightly below average backup, that's pretty good
I don't have high expectations. That doesn't mean though that I can say he looks good when I think he fundamentally doesn't. It's not a huge deal, but I'm just saying I don't think he's looked that great, which affects how they'll need to fill out the roster next year, etc. He looks okay as a guy to eat minutes in garbage time, but I'm just not sure he'll be more than that next year.
We call it a trivalry - all 3 constantly go at war with eat other
Always has been
The Lions will never turn it around as long as the Ford family owns the team. I’ve lost all and complete faith they’ll ever be a championship winning team in my lifetime (29). I’m now pathetically hoping I can see them win a *playoff* game in my lifetime.
If MCDC doesn't win coach of the year I'll be very sad
I ask the same about Alen Smailagic TBH
He hit the only three he took so I don’t know why you’re saying he provides no spacing. And honestly he looks like one of the best passers on our team. Combine that with that pesk he is on defense, he has a bright future imo. He was great in the first half, second half he didn’t play great but he’s a rookie so it happens.
🌎👨‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀
always will be.
He’s our caboclo.  Two years away from being two years away.
I mean, on the spacing I'm taking into account more than this game. He's barely attempted any in both the G league or the NBA and hasn't shot particularly well on a whole. I agree he's a good passer, I just don't know how far that will get him. I also agree he's good on defense, but we have several good defensive guards. So if that's most of what he's offering, I just have a hard time seeing him getting playing time in the future. 

Again, totally agree. He's a rookie who didn't really have an off-season. Just so far, he seems like he's going to get buried because we'll likely have Murray and White playing most of the possible PG minutes unless he develops something that really stands out. Just hoping to see some more flashes at some point.
I mean he’s obviously not going to start over Murray or White in the seasons ahead (assuming they both stick around) but I think he’s capable of serving as the backup PG if Patty is going to decline going forward due to age and such
81 FTS 
3 Technicals 
1 Flagrant 2 

What a fucking shit show
Mason Plumlee what were you doing with those free throws
I'm just glad it's over. What a clusterfuck.
Pistons are the Super Nets bogey team
James harden is really fricken good at basketball
Harden with 44? In other news sky is blue
Nicolas Claxton, this kid is so fucking good
CORY JOSEPH LMFAO
MVP
Blake really pulled a DENNIS on the Pistons. 

I'm frankly surprised Harden isn't in the MVP convo.

Edit: also I can't believe CoJo really rode that 2014 championship ring into making teams think he's a closer.
Harden is pretty good huh.
blake 17 pts in 20 mins.. uh oh
Reports of Blake Griffin's demise have been greatly exaggerated as expected. Most people here tried to tell you he's washed based off his stats in Detroit this year and the last. Griffin didn't even play that well in this game, had 5 fouls, but he was still able to help the Nets, his role is much smaller, all he has to do is get a few open buckets now and then.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out Griffin was going to have horrible stats on a horrible Pistons team. If you were watching him this year, all he did was bring the ball up and pass it to Grant or whoever else, he hardly did anything on the floor. He would just be in the corner doing nothing. Most of the times he would try to score was if the play had already broke down and he had to force something. 

The Nets got an absolute steal signing Griffin. They are obviously going to make better use of his skill set (even though he's older and his body has broken down quite a bit) because they are obviously a better team.
Why the fuck did Joseph go for the pump fake? Fucking hell
IDK why we are not letting Blake inbound with Harden off he is the best passer on the team.
James Harden is good at basketball
Blake and Harden were fun but the free throws made that a pretty brutal watch. i'm ready for Kyrie and KD to come back so Harden doesn't have to do literally everything.
Come on Cory Joseph you gotta know you don't have time for that pump fake lol
This game just took years off my life for many reasons. The main one being **81** combined FT attempts
The beard second MVP? Lessssgooo
Worst officiated game I've seen in a while
You got clowns like Zach Lowe saying Harden shouldn’t even be an All-Star because of the way he left Houston and that is gonna carry over into MVP voting guaranteed 

Harden has been absolutely carrying the Nets and if the Nets finish as a top 2 I don’t see how he isn’t the MVP
Thats exactly why we got CoJo, ez tank commander
From how Harden is playing right now, Nets can probably secure the 1-2 seed and rest Kyrie + Durant until the playoffs LOL.
Cory Joseph: new team, same tank commander
There was 81 freethrows in total taken this game
James harden for MVP. It’s really that simple. GIVE THIS MAN HIS MVP
Harden is the clear MVP.
I'm ok with Blake dunking but the starting fights with saddiq and stew is so lame
CoJo the tank commander. The dude always manages to fuck up every time. It’s incredible.
What in the hell was that Cory
Blake Griffin trick y'all man,like he can't dunk.
I didn't watch the game, but that's a lot of free throws, right?
Legendary win. I felt like I watched history tonight.
wtf is with these late game fuck ups on inbounds...
Blake Griffen need to hit the squats or something
Blake shaking hands after the game, maybe they dont hate each other!
LOL Cory I mean come on
Y'all tried to give that shit away lol
Bruh Cory Joseph with the clutch tank pump fake
Harden’s supporting cast has on somehow ended up being worse than what he had on the Rockets this season yet he’s 2nd in the East. MVP
Blake Griffin revenge game 👀
God the Pistons are annoying. Go away damn
TAKE THAT PISTONS
Thanks CoJo


And Fucking Dirty Flopper Blake Griffin
quality loss.
Why the fuck are you pumpfaking in the paint with under one second left??? Tank commander Joseph. lol
With the game on the line, Dwane Casey really put the ball in... Cory Joseph's hands. Wow
Pistons always making it hell for Brooklyn lol. Gg Nets. 

Quality loss. Our tank continues.
Blake Griffin 17 pts 20 mins. 👀
I was hoping the Pistons would go for the win, but I guess they would have had the advantage in OT with no Harden.
Weaver and Casey knew what they were doing with tank commander Bory Broseph

The tank continues
Hold up our 10 day contract dropped 14 in 10minutes

We should keep him

Edit: wait no that’s frank Jackson but still how’s this man kinda nice but also the most confusing looking person I’ve ever seen
there's something very entertaining at seeing Harden lovers get mad at Harden haters
Outside of the last 3 seconds, Corey Joseph was fine. But Pistons want to lose so it's all good. The Pistons have a lot of good defenders on this team now, I'm excited to see more of these types of games from them this season, get your Bad Boys flags out since to me it seems like that team at least culturaly wise seems to be heading in that direction. They don't have the talent yet, but that's why they tanking this year, I'm excited man Detroit is on the right path and Weaver seems to know what he's doing and Casey has been excellent, the players love playing for the guy seems like everyone has bought in the game plan and the culture and they fighting really hard every game, it's awesome to see, and I urge you all to take a look at some Pistons games when you can, This team is developing really fast and seems to be on the right track to be competitive again, don't let that win record fool you, they are a lil bit of starpower away from being pretty darn good.
Nets really need to sort out their inbounding plays thought this was going to be wizards game all over again
Blake Griffin is still a bitch confirmed.
Says something about Blake Griffin that the entire Pistons team seemed to want to kill him the entire game.
That's what you get when the refs decide to give every little contact.
Holy fuck how long was the game?!
The pistons were playing physical as fuck and it was crazy choppy
His free throw form looks like Barkley's golf swing.
His best
Also why did Plumlee decide to dribble up the court when they had enough time to shoot for a 3 and tie the game? wtf was that
Why was he on the court is the better question
Preserving the tank
Who has a worse FT form - Plumlee or Saban Lee?
I think they've played every contender real tightly, even managed to beat a few.
only one super net was playing lol
Lmfao. My man pumpfaked with 3 seconds to go after driving to the rim. What the fuck?
Lmao I saw him take the last shot and playing clutch time and tbh I’m pretty impressed with their tanking ability. He’s probably the most tank friendly player we’ve had in a long time.
Cory
CoJo?
Best description of current blake I've read on here recently. He's closer to his real 2019 self, his all around one of the best seasons in his career too. He got a new knee after carrying the pistons to a first round exit against the bucks. No way he'd suddenly decline that fast.
Have you seen his other two games? He still looks horrible.
He had a month off to rest, don't expect healthy Blake to last very long
Nets are going to get more use out of him because now he is willing to try to get a ring with a super team. He hardly did anything because he phoned it in and sandbagged the team who is actually paying him.
Pistons fans will come to learn that he will *always* manage to fuck up in a big way late in games. It never fails.
Claxton put that big long D on him
would’ve got blocked by clax if he’d shot it
Because without Harden/Kyrie/Durant, it’s probably not worth putting in the extra elbow grease for a regular season game. Blake was pretty bad on the Pistons because they gave him too many minutes and too much responsibility. The Nets aren’t first seed yet but the Sixers are about to hit a rough patch in their schedule and I’d be surprised if they can hold on without Embiid.
Scorching hot takes like this is why I come to the post-game threads.
Its nice to see the chemistry hes built along the way though.
Wtf??
I usually respect his opinion but that’s one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard
He probably won’t be because he’s harden which is a fuckin joke.
Lmao here come the salty nuggets fans waiting to discredit harden. Dude is the fucking mvp and I don’t give a shit
Because clowns like Zach Lowe are the ones who vote for MVP
yeah i had embiid and lebron over him but at this point harden should be the favorite. would be surprised if he even finishes top 3 tho
I mean that is going to carry over though. Narrative has a big influence on MVP voting which is obviously shitty because Harden is playing at an MVP level but the way he quit on Houston will leave a bad taste for voters.
Yea it’ll definitely carry over into MVP voting. And I don’t mind it tbh. I don’t think it’s a good idea to set the precedent that you can force your way out of a team and win MVP in the same year. I expect loads of downvotes for this, but it’s just my opinion
Harden is being disrespected in the mvp race but I honestly think jokic should still get it over him
He's carried the Nets for two games, one of which was against the second-worst team in the league. Yeah MVP alright. Christ...
Harden is averaging 39mpg though.
Funny thing is that he really wasn't even that great tonight, that's how good he is.
I’d be shocked if they didn’t get a top 2 seed. Embiid is still out and the 4th place team in the conference is the 22-21 Hornets. They would need to bench the entire team to not get a top 3 seed.
Better to test harden and get whatever seed
[deleted]
Still happy with the move. He was making Pistons basketball so hard to watch.
It was miserable
Refs were extremely whistle-happy tonight, even 5 technicals this game
Good player gets fouled
That’s just a regular Friday at the office for Jimbo Slice.
Rockets cast might have more talent but the Nets cast actually knows their roles which is the key factor here.
Lol Joe Harris alone is better fit and player than anyone on the current rockets team sans Christian Wood,and Jeff Green ain't far behind.
Harris, Green, Brown, Claxton, and Blake are all quality players
Much better than what he had. And cp3 and kyrie have the same Lower leg issues too
That's because KD, Kyrie, Shamet are all out. When they come back it's obviously many times better. It's still better than Houston of this year without them.
Revenge for what?
EVERYTIME YOU BEAT US WE BECOME MORE POWERFUL
Very chippy game.. He dapped up a few of his old team mates afterwards so I’m sure it wasn’t that bad
True! Some of the calls we re actually ridiculous
about 2 hours ad 51 minutes
>The pistons were playing physical as fuck

I NEVER THOUGHT I'D READ THIS AGAIN WE'RE BACK BOYS😤

BOUT FUCKIN TIME PISTONS BASKETBALL IS PHYSICAL BASKETBALL - ANYTHING LESS IS A PERSONAL ATTACK ON THE LEGACY OF ALL THE PLAYERS BILL LAIMBEER & RICK MAHORN YEETED IN A PISTONS UNIFORM
Bitch ass Blake Griffin flopped on the pistons back up center and he got ejected. Fuck Blake
We play everyone really tightly, it’s a tough team to beat. It lacks the talent to win many games though which is why the upcoming draft is crucial
No wonder Detroit took him. The every tanks needs its pistons of course.
But physically he is seriously diminished. It’s just that in a limited role he can still help
Dude is gonna have 1 good game every 10 and people are gonna make posts like this every time
Do we need Blake in the regular season that much? If it happens just rest him
It might... he's gonna play like 15-20 minutes 3 nights a week, never on back to backs.
He's had better games for Detroit this season though, with way more responsibility and minutes... Man's body is just worn down.

Sure the Nets will get these kind of nights from him once in a while, since we only need 15-20 minute spurts of energy and he gets to play with a top tier facilitator, but I'd imagine there's gonna be a lot of single digit scoring nights as well.
Hey, we embrace our new tank commander!
Weaver playing 4D chess out here
Harden didn't win MVP in 2019 when he averaged that 2K statline of 36/8/7 carrying an injured Rockets team to the 4th seed. (1 win away from 2nd seed).

Why should Jokic or Dame win MVP as 4th/5th seeds with a less dominant season?

Narratives has always plagued Harden and it's going to continue this year.
"but see defensive LEBRAPTOR win share rating has Jokic marginally above average defender, which means elite and seeding doesn't matter!!"
Only reason Jokic going to win 
A. Media hates Harden 
B. LeBron and Embid got hurt
The media is more upset about it than houston fans.  We're over here laughing at how hopeless we are without him.  We just gave up a 22-0 run to end the 4th and lose to the twolves.  

If you love them then set them free.  Go get your ring Harden.
Didn’t he always in Houston anyway?
Yeah he missed a ton of gimmes. He should have had 60
Yeah his stat line was obviously incredible, but it didn’t feel like he was dominating the game like he usually does in his best performances
I mean they’ve beat good teams too including us while missing 1 or 2 of the big 3
And the Nets have beaten all good teams so...he’s pretty much right?
Nets have beaten the Suns who are the 2nd seed in the West and Blazers who are the 6th seed without either one of KD or Kyrie playing
Ah okay, this is the first game harden has won for the nets
It was just a super physical game. There were several np-calls on both sides too
clax disrespect
Stealing $36 Million from the Pistons
This was a really physical game, I thought the refs let a lot go if anything.
Break out the Raiders gear.
That's not really a justification, just play small in that situation. Also Blake didn't flop he got hit in the face and the refs made the wrong decision. Get you're heated though.
That's the icing on the cake! He had to carry that team compared to being the 6th option on the nets. Yes he's declined athletically, but not to geriatric levels that was shown this and last year on the pistons.
Nuggets fans are going to give you a advanced stat crash course
They always bring out RAPTOR smh
Jokic is carrying a worse team in a much harder conference, scoring more than Harden, scoring more efficiently than Harden, shooting the 3 better than Harden, he's a better passer than Harden. He has 0 Hall of Famers to help him, compared to 3.

lol...
Definitely, everyone feeling outraged for us, when we don't need/want it lol.   


Most of us still love the guy and want him to get a ring, as we tank to a top 3 pick
He must be so tired, dude controls every single offensive possession.
Harden hasnt beat the Sixers.  Got his ass beat when he came to Philly
You cannot seriously believe this.
It was the lob that set me off tbh
KD has barely played.
Didn't we beat you guys without any of Harden, Kyrie, and Durant?? Lmfaoo don't talk any shit
Therefore his other wins don't count right?
He’s 16-5 vs 76ers lol. He also averages 28.5 points, 6.8 assists and 6.7 rebound. I’m pretty sure he can beat the 76ers
You still haven't played the Nets this season with Kyrie or KD playing
/s
#owned lol
oh okay I was worried for a second. My mistake.
well now that the clippers have won I will congratulate the pistons on somehow fielding steph curry and four of his clones tonight
Who’s stopping the clippers superstar wing duo of Paul George and Marcus Morris?
the clips don't ever seem to go cold from 3. they are amazing.
The pistons feel bad boy again
If you didn't watch this game, you missed one of the strangest and weirdly entertaining games of the year.  I've never seen a game that was so sloppily played where both teams were also making everything.  It was bananas.
PG was obviously more dominant and consistent in 2019 but I rlly think this is the most complete he's ever been. Dudes out here throwing lobs regularly now
That was a fun game! Gg detroit!
PG has been amazing
Damn PG really doesn't get a lotta calls
Best shooting team in the league
We need a PG ft attempt complaint thread like jokic has after every game
Clippers shot 57% from 3 while PG was 1-5.
Pistons and Clippers have a surprising amount of history involving personnel and players, plus this was one of the most funny and fun games of the season.


Not to mention Bey with the efficient 25 points, I love my clipper boys over on the west

Edit: We also both got that Laker hate within us so I wanna see yall shine
Pistons shot 52/45/89 and lost because the clippers shot 62/57/75. Absolute unit of a game. I feel bad for people who didn't watch lmao
Ty Lou needs to get ejected from a game one of these days to prove a point how bad officiating has been against Paul George, it’s getting ridiculous at this point.
Rondo + Batum off the bench is too OP. Those guys make the right play again and again.
Batum +29 off the bench 😤
The Pistons had tons of fight in them and just would not die. Much respect, GGWP.
 
When the Clippers get the W, I get a little chubby dude
Man, seasons like these are tricky. On one hand, it's definitely nice to see a better culture and work ethic evolve, and to see young players excelling. On the other hand, you're kinda worried about that going too far, especially as some teams around us are in free fall, and knocking us out of the top 4/5 pick range. 

I wish I could just root for us to win without any reservations, I hate the stupid draft lottery.

Team looked very nice tonight though.
that was one of the wildest games ive seen all year

edit: also o/u 150 comments?
We are witnessing a new PG13.
this game was so fun to watch, just insane offense and shot making
O/U on 80 comments?
**Paul George.**
My nba scores app informs me if a clips game is ending and if its close. For awhile it gave me anxiety, but at this point I just tell myself they'll slug it out. Good game bois. 7 mins left with 3 pt deficit and you turned it to a win.
Clutch loss
Those final possessions were so weird lol, I get the pistons wanted to win but fouling down 10..
Yeah, it's pretty tough to win when the other team shoots 62% from the field.
Saddiq carrying my 20 team fantasy league team.
Luke and Mann****
thereve been a few — some of those losses just before the ASB when they dropped games to the Celtics and wizards and some other team (Milwaukee maybe?) they had—not exactly cold but not good enough shooting nights and wound up losing
Just hope it doesn't happen in playoffs
Just wait for the playoffs. It's coming.
they had us in the first half
Hmm I don't remember the FG%, but the almost record setting Rockets Wizards game from last year (or was it 2 years ago?) was very entertaining.

159-158 and in only 4 quarters lmao. Defense was not on the menu that night.
detroit wouldnt miss off their iso plays, mad annoying
I was watching this game saying wtf to myself
With the thunder?
Noticed it a bit ago aswell
He caught a lot of flak for not attacking enough last season and early this season. Now he does and still gets no whistles. Kinda annoying
Yep. It’s crazy. He should have had double digits in fts tonight
I am glad someone other than a clipper fan noticed.
**of all time
Aw thanks for the kind words
It's getting ridiculous. Not quite Jokic level yet but we're getting close
Man gets hacked
Off game for PG, who probably is the best shooting wing of all time
To Detroit and LA got that NFL connect now
There’s a bunch of former Pistons players on the lakers clippers and nets this year. 

You welcome for bey fam
Sources say Saddiq Bey still hasn't missed a basket, even after the final whistle.
For real lol so glad i tuned in tonight
Probably my favorite game of the year. I love this fucking team
Thank you!!!  I have been asking since that Nets home game.  It is frustrating as fuck to watch.
Gotta be careful with that. Nuggets/Malone tried that for Jokic and it did not end well. But really, why isn't he getting calls this season? Last season I felt like he wasn't driving to the rim enough to warrant enough scrutiny, but this year he's been aggressive getting to the rim and gets whacked like crazy. Is it because once refs start thinking someone's primarily a jump shooter they just flip a switch in their heads and forget to flip it back?
One of our best defenders in the team through the season
The real buyout steal of the year
on a vet min thank you charlotte very cool
Should send some wine to Charlotte/MJ/Hayward for how that all went down.
This is a team that's much better then their record. Their guys fought hard. Bunch of young studs on that team
there
There it is
Whoomp!
Was frantically looking for this. Why isn't it at the top of the thread, people?!
We did it fam
Yessir
There it is!
so basically this game was perfect for you
Under, fo sho.
Those fucking refs
Peaking P
i need this PG in the playoffs all playoffs
Over 80, under 100.
they are young i think casey is doing a good job teaching them when to foul in close games. even though it is not close
Right I mean they even got what I guess you’d want — some missed clipper FTs, two quick 3s, got it down to 7 and then...just quit? 

Like I know the spread was 10, maybe they just had some cousins who bet the under and needed to get them paid?
Batum and Goggles Reggie Jackson**
Just hope it keeps up in the playoffs\*\*\*\*
ratioed for saying something stupid
lol, that was the game the Wiz shot like 60/50/80 and still lost right? The Nets-Wiz game earlier this year was a lot of fun too.  The thing that took tonight's game over the top for me was there were points were it looked like both teams were trying to give the game away but they couldn't because neither team could miss even if they wanted to.
Didn't the broadcast says at one point we have 23 assist on 30 fgm. That's not iso plays. I'm glad clips pulled out in the end clutch loss on our end
Yea his last year with them
Was he driving to the rack a lot tonight? He led your team in FTA tonight, but yeah I don't know if that's the whole story
Lmfao, not even the best shooting wing who played for the Pacers.
Also Chauncey is your assistant coach
Over the Atlanta game??
Where would we be without Batum and Reggie both on vet min
We're just missing the young super star talent who can close out games, which hopefully we'll rectify in this draft.
They’re tanking for Cade
It
There it is
By the end, yeah 100%. But at times we were up 10 and you're stoked to see them showing out but also sweating because you can see Jalen Green turning into Jalen Johnson.
We can win the 2nd round championship if he plys like this
You may have called that perfectly
they needed to hit a three to hit the over for the quarter and just so happened to buy time to do it, kinda sus lol
4 of his fts were in the final 5 mins. Almost all of his points were from drives, only made one 3 and had some pretty great finishes tonight. Should've easily had double digits fta
Which wing in history averages 38% from 3 on more than 6 attempts for their career?
Oh I meant the 2019 Pistons team
I missed the ending :(
somewhere between 4th and 8th
I feel it. Besides that and some inside offense, y'all pretty complete
One of the best stealth tanks I've seen. Play hard, most games go close, beat top teams. They're gonna have a tough time if they get too stealthy to catch up to the Rockets and Magic after their firesales.
Is
Which wing averaged 40% from 3 on the third most makes ever and **actually** got a team to the finals?
> more than 6 attempts for their career

You realize you're basically eliminating anyone that played before 2013 right?

Ray Allen's career avg is 5.7 3pa, Reggie Miller's is 4.7.

Not even Steph Curry was taking more than 5 3's a game before 2013.

Allen, Curry, and Miller are the players with the most made 3s in NBA history.

6 attempts is a meaningless number and all it accomplishes is to skew the results to players who have played in the last decade and took an extremely high number of 3s.
Yea I know but in general we have a lot of players and former players on your team in one way or another
Duuuuuuude that's tragic. But, then, I missed most of this game because I was running around a fucking Wal-Mart. God it was terrible.
Currys 2019 season is 3rd all time in threes in a season, and he isn’t a wing. Paul George’s 2019 season is 6th, and he is the first wing on the list. And if you are referring to Reggie Miller, he attempted far less threes than PG does, and he also isn’t a wing. And what does reaching the finals have to do with good three point shooting? You can reach the finals and be a terrible shooter
Fine, if you adjust for volume and divide 3pt % by attempts, PG is still higher
Aw man I'm sorry, that's the worst. I'm gonna try and find a replay of the atl gsme
If miller attempted way less 3s than George but has made way more, doesn't that prove my point? Your nephew is showing.
I am now 100% convinced that you are 100% trolling.
Paul George hasn’t played nearly the similar amount of games as Miller
It took me until just now to read your username and realize you're a troll lol. Well played
Do you seriously expect Paul George to have made more shots on vastly less games?
you can stop man i figured that bit out, it's all good
Wizards almost at the play-in and they have the 5th easiest remaining schedule
Washington is so fun to watch
westbrook with 11 ast and only 2 tov letsss goooo
Wizards as the play in team is a good thing
LFG, Washington!
Wizards now tied in record with the Bulls
we boutta dominate the play-ins
I love to see a healthy Wizards squad playing. Hopefully Rui & Len can come back real soon
Beef Stew is the best center in the past two draft, argue wit ya mama
Another triple double for Russ. Insane. Dude is leading and willing this team to relevancy.
It just hilarious how much Cory Joseph plays for this team these days.  We have a million guards and he's out there soaking up 30 minutes a night.  Great for the tank.
PHEW
bulls and wizards wins heck yea
Beal been playing better off late, but the defense still...well, doesn't exist. God, he used to be a good defender.  
In my wet dreams, Russ takes max 15 shots per game and averages 20 assists.
I'm routing for the Wizards baby
nice bounce back bradley, keep it up.
Their next game is against OKC and the bulls next game is against Boston.

I’m not saying anything is a given but they should be in the play-in spot in a couple days
Cannot wait for Scottie Brooks to somehow fuck this up.
Yes, please.
I’m obviously biased, but I think no one wants us in the play in. We have the highest ceiling out of the possible play in teams. But we just don’t hit it that often. But every few games when it all clicks, we’re scary
Nets scared right now
It'll be stupid as well when Edwards wins the RoTY over him. His only hope is if Zach Lowe picks him on his ballot to get his profile up.
I think Russ will kill Brooks before he allows that. I love Russ - he’s taking y’all there no matter what
Nets don't want to face the Wizards. They'd win the series but it would be an annoying series for the Nets to go 6 games against.
Well you kinda have a point, thing is all the teams in the east play-in fucking suck. So yeah, perhaps the east 7-9 aren't too hot about you guys. But Sixers or Nets would demolish you in 4, Rui, Deni and Russ can't shoot, it's not that hard to lock down if you actually prepare.  
I would love to watch Wiz in the play-in though, so go get those Bulls!
I really can't see Washington taking two games off the Nets. I guess in theory they have a high offensive ceiling with Russ and Beal but that roster outside of those two is a dumpster fire and Russ hasn't had a good playoff series in 5 years
It really depends on if Russ can focus for the second win, because he'll be good for one.

Russ has familiarity with KD and Harden that he can use to his advantage and he can lowkey guard Kyrie with his wingspan and athleticism.
You obviously don't watch any Wizards games. We're 2-1 vs the Nets
Imo it really depends on the role players clicking.

They need to match the offensive power and crash the glass with their youngins. Their defense is already shit and the Nets would score at will anyways. Just have to put pressure on the Nets all game
Imagine if you guys knock them out. There will be a greater collective orgasm than last year when Nugs beat Dippers
Well, the Nets swept the Heatles in the regular season once, got drubbed in the playoffs.
Harden didn't play in either of those wins, and it's only the regular season. I remember the Bulls sweeping the regular seasons series against Miami in Rose's MVP season only to get waxed by Miami in the playoffs. Regular season wins don't always translate to playoff success. Looking at both teams on balance I don't think Washington have enough to take two games off Brooklyn
Thunder swept the Blazers in the regular season in 2019. We all know what happened in the playoffs.
sign me up for this timeline
Nobody on this sub will give a shit about this one, but this was huge for us.
There were some weird referee decisions in this game
This was lowkey a must-win for us. It wasn't pretty but we'll take the W however we can
Got tired of teams like the Thunder and Rockets blatant tanks, so we gave Cory Joseph 36 minutes tonight.
DSJ still wants to be a Mav.......
Jalen Brunson may be the best backup PG in the league
We needed this L

Gg’s Mavs, please become really good again so kid me can be happy
I only watched part of this game, but Porzingis landing after his dunks is nightmare fuel.
So hooray? Yay!
Us too!
Yep.  Had to go to page 2 to find this thread.  If the Mavs lost it would have been a different story.
The refs are bad in literally every single game. It’s a defining feature of the NBA.
Multiple phantom foul calls, a kicked ball that never was, ignoring Luka getting karate kicked in the balls... Even harder to watch live.
There was nothing lowkey about it lol.
He put up an efficient 24 points, I wouldn't hate on it too hard
Slangin’ wood off into the sunset…
We miss him. I’m still sad that didn’t work out
I think hes good enough to start on some teams but don't tell anyone
Or so it would seem...
What was really nightmare fuel was Luka getting hit in the air mid aley oop attempt and falling backwards. That was scary
hope tank szn is throughly successful. hoping for a cade in your future 🙏🏼
Yeah I know that. But for instance in this game the overall criteria was quite good. But then they reviewed 2 plays and their final decision was completely the opposite as everyone was expecting (and saw in the replay).
I'm sorry dude but some of us are keenly aware lmao
That no call is Luka's rage fuel
Yet another reason why replay has no business in basketball. The refs are going to be bad either way, so let’s just deal with calls as they come and get on with it.
I wouldn't be surprised if that's the last Luka alley oop attempt when nearby an opposing player. You could hear a pin drop in that arena for a few seconds
Come on LeVert, can't be missing 6 free throws!
what a fun tj statline
Wow this was hours late. Just shows how dead the fan bases are for the injuried Pacers and bum pistons
Dang they played the game a second time and got the same score?
I've always liked TJ since his days with the process because you can clearly see the talent. And it seems Indy has placed him in a position to become better.

Yeah was wondering where the thread was.. was the game that bad or something?
[deleted]
The whole fanbase just wnats to lose now and we can't even do that right
It was fine down the stretch, but the long and short of it is that the Pistons are bad and the Pacers are injured so it’s not really incentivized to watch/engage.
I was keeping up with it and the best way I can summarize it is "fine." If a game between two good teams went exactly like this one did, it would get a lot more attention.
It was a strange sort of NBA basketball.

The tiny surviving Pacers would go straight to the rim and get their shot halfway off it, and the Pistons would come about three-quarters of the way up the court and give the ball back. Again and again.
They get used for the big games. I’m just saying an injured team vs a rebuilding team isn’t going to get much attention lol
That pretty much sums up Pistons basketball this year
I want to be like you when I grow up
Strategy to at least compete with the Lakers in the playoffs:

1) Sign all the Pistons players

2) Dress up in Pistons uniforms

3) Play home games in Detroit

4) Profit
That was an ***uuuuuugly*** win. GG Pistons.
23 fucking turnovers. The Lakers got lucky. Good thing this is the last matchup vs the Pistons this year.
Jesus Christ that was a wild game
Without Caruso Lakers lose in OT 100%. Man has been nasty from the 3 this season.
Josh Jackson has no business hurting my feelings this much. Also, we should pay Alex Caruso 12 million a year with a smile on our face, idgaf. This was a game we honestly deserve to lose.
Caruso is legit one of the most important players on this team, but I understand limiting his minutes for now because we need him to go 110% down the line in the playoffs.

That big 3 came exactly when we needed him to make it and I love him so much for his massive leap in shooting this year.
There's a fine line between coasting and making fans wanna claw their eyes out and we were definitely treading that shit tonight holy hell 🤢

Just saw that AD has made 4 threes in his last 11 games, hope he snaps out of it because that isn't going to cut it at all.
Lebron: *sees Plumlee guarding him in OT*

Also LeBron: *and I took that personally*
Found the real post game thread
Another reminder that the Lakers are blessed that Detroit is in the East
>IM 36!!!!! IM 36!!!! STOP THROWING THE BALL 😡😡😡🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀
LeBron on some Wanda Maximoff shit there in double OT. Just glared at the Pistons and said "no" and that was that game over
We won, but we lost lol
Father Time: Lebron you’re too tired now, too slow to drive past him

*LeFuckYou 3*

Father Time: wait that’s illegal
Damn if this ended in regulation an entire different story. LeBron had a whole character arc in like 20 minutes. Dude went 0/5 with a TO to end regulation and let the Pistons take it to OT and then hit two clutch threes in 2OT to win the game and redeem himself. That's sick.
Thank god we don't have to face the pistons again this season lol
Don’t get it twisted Lebron is absolutely still the #1 guy on this team
LeBron really going to be a top 5 player until he 42 isn't he? Fucking perfect in the clutch.
The Pistons when they play the Lakers are a 70 win team, Plumlee made AD look like McGee, that shit is just unacceptable for a superstar.
I don't wanna face pistons in the playoffs. period. end of story.
This doesn't feel like a win.
Like I said in the game thread, we lost, but that was a good ass effort. This is without Rose and Blake. Grant can ball. Hopefully we'll start being competitive
The trio of Josh Jackson, Delon Wright and Jerami Grant combined for 82 points and 12/24 from three
Lakers had a scoring drought in the 4th lasting 5:54 that continued into the 1st overtime. They had possessions in the 4th where they took 15+ seconds just to get into the offense. The team committed 23 turnovers making sloppy passes and being careless with the ball. Some nights the team is just not focused when they go up against a perceived lesser opponent. Josh Jackson was really instrumental in hitting key threes for the pistons and cutting the lead in the 4th.
We always suck against the pistons...they play with energy against us....jerami grant is a great signing for them.
Thank god we don’t play the Pistons again.
5 quarters of LeBored, 1 barrage of LeFuckYou3s to call it a night. Schroder was good all night, Clutchtime Caruso woke up in OT.
Josh Jackson reclamation project looking nice so far
We found the biggest threat to the lakers: The pistons
lakers is lucky they would not facing this detroit team in playoff
AD just a poor man's Mason plumlee
We really didn't deserve to win this one. The Pistons were missing Blake and D-Rose while we had the full roster AND we led by 17 at some point. Good game, Detroit. See you in the Finals.
Josh Jackson came to play
LeBron was amazing in the second OT, but gotta also give credit to Caruso. He kept the Lakers alive in the first OT with that inbound and-1 plus a clutch 3. We don't win this one without him
Already said this but the Pistons terrify me
a win is a win, but clowns, including skip are gloating over an almost Lakers / Lebron loss.
the luxury of having lebron jfc I feel offended for every other team out there
Holy fuck pistons, y’all hella balled out today gg. Shoutout to LeBron and Caruso today
pistons turn into the 73 win warriors against us
Alex Caruso saved game... again!
Here for it, 7 game Pistons Lakers series. Make it happen Silver.
Plumlee took the most Ls since OT started. From our announcers shitting on how bad he was on offense and LeBron draining those b2b LeFuckYou3s
Lmao LeBron finally just went "screw it lets go home"
I'm not sure why everyone's freaking out, Jordan and the Bulls struggled with the Pistons too!
Pistons Lakers finals is going 7
I don't understand Casey's lineup decisions at all.

Stewart just had a double double and played a great game against the Lakers last week, and he gets 10 minutes tonight?

Happy to take the loss and make the Lakers' lives more difficult, but I just can't figure out who gets playing time and why.
This game had no business being this competitive, props to the Pistons for never going away

Fuck the refs
Do the Pistons have our number or something? Goddamn
Ugly win
mixed feelings
This game is so frustrating.
Very well played, Pistons!
This ain't nothing to be proud about
Father Carushow sparked this team once again.
Did Lebron share the recipe of his secret stuff on Grant after WCF?
That Schroeder highkey one of the best signings this last off season
That was some horrible reffing during the 4th and OT
When a win is a loss. 

Bad effort and bad fundamentals tonight, need to do better if we want to repeat.
Lakers did their best to throw it away. But came up clutch in the OTs
Father Time: LeBron it's time to go man you're old you can't carry the load anymore.

LeBron: *LeFuckYou3*
Yeah. I don't want to play against Detroit again.
who would have thunk the real cogs of the 2020 Western conference finalist nuggets team were Grant and Plumlee.
The game never should have gotten to this point, but at least we won.
Only good thing from that game is the W
Luckily Jeremy Grant is in the east now
Pistons deserve a lot more respect than the Lakers gave them in both games. 

Thank fuck we don't play them again. GG
That was a finals preview.
Usually it’s the magic that gives the lakers problems, I guess this year it’s the pistons
What does Gasol actually offer this team? Genuine question for Laker fans. Wouldn’t you prefer to have kept Dwight and McGee instead of Gasol?
There is a player on every team that has saved all there game for a chance to put up an unreal game against us. Josh Jackson was that player this game.
I just want to show love for Alex Caruso. I didn't even watch the game. But I tell you what, the first few times I saw Caruso play with Lebron were amazing. You can tell that Caruso understands how to play with Lebron and the synergy is real. 

Caruso plays defense with energy knowing it's not his job to be a primary scorer, he gets deflections and steals a good amount of the time and I do not often see him blowing coverage. On the fast break, he knows who to pass the ball to, and more importantly, when not to pass the ball and take it to the rim himself. 

I also like a bit of his story, playing in the G league and whatnot. I dislike the nickname Carushow and I like like like the nickname Bald Mamba. 

&#x200B;

<3 Caruso
#[LAKERS ROAD TO CHAMPIONS 66-6](https://streamable.com/9bhkw)


Edit: let’s just pretend this game didn’t exist
Game never should’ve gone to ot tbh. We had so many guys playing with 5 fouls including plumlee. Instead of driving in the paint where we were playing soft lebron kept waiting till 5 seconds left before running a play.
LeBron got fed up and ended it.
[deleted]
You already know how many /r/nba losers deleted the posts they made from their drafts before OT started
Lebron is by far the MVP front runner, right?
Fun, trashy win. GG Detroit.
Hell of a game. Props to Detroit for pulling themselves back into it.
Lebron is 36 years old. How is he still doing it?
You’d think the LeBron and AD pick and roll would be unstoppable but it feels like it’s one of our worst offensive plays. 

Also, it’s insane how good AD is on defense. He hasn’t been dominant offensively this year, but his defense has been consistently ridiculous.
Lakers are bored at right now. Going through the motions
88pts through 3 quarters, 18 in the 4th. I really wish we’d stop falling asleep in the final minutes. 

Glad we survived this but worried we won’t be able to against championship teams if we don’t make some changes.
Can we get a 7 game series of Lakers vs Pistons please
Lakers went hard against a bottom team 🤣
Damn this game almost had me 🤯🥶
Tired old lebron coming in clutch to bail us out sheesh
Nothing brings me more joy as a Raptors fan to see LeBron in the West.
So close man
Pretty sure the game went to 2 ots because Lebron didn't have his 5 rebounds for 15/5/5 record.
WHEW
i missed most of the game - how did this go to 2OT?!
KCP playing 40 minutes and only taking 6 shots and scoring 4 points is weird man.
LeIwantMyIceBathNowThree
Evil Buu was clutch today
the whole let jerami grant do whatever he wants while the team tanks thing is pretty funny to watch
In 2OT
They're going to have SO much fun watching the tape on this one.
Redemption
Pistons best them a few weeks back and almost again tonight. Teams should get some of these guys as their bench players
As a Lakers fan this was a giant L, don’t care what the scoreboard says.
So no awards for the lakers winning but if they’d lose there would be 100 aight
LeClutch w the LeFuckYou 3s
why no THT late in the 4th when we couldn't play any worse
Fucking hell man
We really shouldn't be going to 2 OT's against what was essentially the Pistons bench. AD really needs to get his consistency back and remember how to shoot free throws.
Goat Caruso. Wild game. I’m wondering why Pistons record now is only 5-18. With the game like this, Pistons can be top 3 in the East. Someone plz kindly explain to me
[deleted]
You don't know how many times I was this close to punching my computer.
Jordan > Lebron
This kinda of performance is why I keep saying the Lakers have no chance against the nets playing like this. We were so much better last year with Dwight, Javale and Rondo. 

Our half court offense is a mess. Having lob threats when you can’t do anything in the half court is extremely valuable. It’s easy points. Gasol has to go...
[deleted]
Damn didn't know Steph was playing 2 games tonight

LeFuckYou3s
#LAbron James
AD too soft need Dwight and his 12 children.
Game was never in doubt AD and Bron just wanted to pad their stats
Somebody finally included all the steps in the process. 2021 is a strange and beautiful time.
Hasn't this already been the strategy since 2004? 🤨
I think Lakers fans never want to see a Pistons jersey again 😂😂😂
Until the finals
Turnovers will always be a problem with this team. We had the same problem last year. I'm not too worried considering we won the chip doing the same.
Honestly, it's been a bit of an issue for them the entire season so far. Need to get better about those TO's.
Honestly I don’t remember the last time I saw the lakers in double OT.
The Pistons do that sometimes. No opponent can take them from granted because once they do, the Pistons turn it around mid-game and make it tense down the stretch. Same thing happened on Tuesday against the Jazz, when they were down nearly 30 and came back to within 5 or so. The Pistons are a bad team, but they play with a lot of heart and effort
Indeed
He came in and instantly produced for the team after we were slumping hard. That AND1 and 3 pointer were ice cold
Hijacking this to let us take a moment to appreciate Alex Caruso's career thus far.  Dude busted his butt in the G league, made his way up to a bench filler, then legitimate roll player on a championship team and starting an overtime game next to LeBron and AD.  Amazing.
One of the best 3&D guys in the league this season imo
Been on a cold streak recently but man, dude has a knack for hitting them when they matter.
Jackson actually looked like a former top 5 pick tonight
Caruso kept them in it in the first OT for sure.
You guys deserved to lose until you didn't. Bron was chucking up bricks in the 4th and then somehow flipped a switch and hit back to back threes
*30 million
Caruso with a legit 3 is dangerous
Man he fucking saved us multiple times lol I think we all feel better when he’s on the floor down the stretch
Yeah, when I'm so disgusted that I'm torn if I really want the Lakers to win over that late regulation/early OT1 stretch, its not a good sign. Thank God Caruso came to play & Bron woke up.
Was he always this inconsistent when he played for the pels? Dude is built to dominate but just doesn’t every game like he should.
was that a switch? was so weird lol
For real. 

"I don't know how to do the box score sorry" then maybe don't put up a PGT? So frustrating
Took 3 attempts 😅
After the two games they've played against us, I really don't understand how they are the worst team in the NBA.
"AD, gimme your ring"
Straight up rolled the credits
"No more overtimes."
LeScarlet Witch
After AD hit the shot to put us up, when they were transitioning you could see that "Game 6 Brow Furrowed" look on LeBron. He wanted to end it.
Wandavision taking over r/nba  👀😂
Reality warper
We lost, but we won lol. 

You can’t escape your destiny Cade
My thoughts exactly. Pistons well on our way to that lottery pick!
40+ minutes for our two superstars at home against a sub .500 team missing key players? I'd say so
Josh Jackson is a 29% shooter and goes 5-10 from 3. I think Blake Griffin had a season high 23 pts and goes 5-10 from 3 last game. It's like the sliders went up when against Lakers.
I'm just super glad the season series with Detroit is over

They turn into the Bad Boys when they play the Lakers. Fucking hell
*another LeFuckYou3*
Then 20 seconds later: LeFuckYou3Again!
 Pretty sure the game went to 2 ots because Lebron didn't have his 5 rebounds for 15/5/5 record.
just like the stock market
Gotta get those numbers up for the MVP
Everyone knows this
The world
Lol who ever said or implied otherwise???
This leaugue *
only delusional fans think AD has surpassed him, now I don't know what's happening with that guy might be injury or lost his motivation but he's not ready to be #1 guy yet I guess, when Bron retires they need to get him another real superstar or 2 all stars at least.
...who said otherwise?
he went 0/5 and a TO in the last 3 minutes of regulation ion know about perfect

that being said those threes were FILTHY and lefuckyou status
LeImmortal
People praying on his downfall, can't wait to talk shit after a few minutes of bad play...

Then when he proves yet again why he's #1, they all disappear... I love it

Ugly win tho. This near loss is more on Vogel & AD than LeBron, that's for sure
Even when he loses all his athleticism, he can probably still scrape by with passing and LeFuckYou 3s.
You just knew they were going in too.
Till 39 I think at least. Will be legendary if he remains top 5 at 40.
Was chucking up bricks in the 4th and then just flipped a switch and hit back to back threes.
Lebron with those clutch layups and threes against the Pistons reminded me of his 07 self.
Dude had 5 fouls & AD was shooting fadeaways on him instead of going into his body. Completely unacceptable.
AD went 13-22 for 30 points lol.
They're not getting to the Finals, which is the only time a Western team will face them in the playoffs.
I swear we always struggle to beat this team and also Portland over the last 2 decades.
just remember, don't let them know that we play waaay better without either of them on the court.
Great game. I hope the Piston fans are happier than the Lakers fans, because that was the most painful win ever. You guys deserved it more.
How do you feel about josh jackson? Hopefully this gets him back on track, I thought he was looking really solid for you guys then he got injured and it kind of derailed that, hopefully this game gets him back on the rails.
I cant wait until we get enough ppl vaccinated that we can get some fans back into the stands. Some of the shooting we are seeing this season is crazy & I suspect the empty gym plays a part in it.
Fr. That game was painfully sloppy and infuriating to watch. I hate to be that guy reminiscing about the past but Kobe would not let this shit slide.
Last year with Dwight, rondo and Javale we destroyed the Pistons. These current Lakers are MUCH worse....
Mason "Team USA" Plumlee
Kind of hard to say that when Plumlee got exposed by LeBron 3 plays in a row to seal the game but yeah AD is off to a rocky start
As a Lakers fan, you don't want to say that.
To think that a lot of Laker fans were against getting Lebron because he was "too old".
Bron doesn't mind playing the 73 win dubs
And the 2 drives on him before that which were easy layups. They switched Plumlee on AD and they literally made sure they switched him back on to LeBron. Abusive.
I think Stewart is too aggressive for his own good at times.
He had 5 fouls, Casey said something the other week about not wanting the rookies to develop bad habits - so he was definitely disciplining him
Would you believe the pistons have had one of the hardest 1st half schedules so far?
feels like they are too young and fast for us
There were some calls missed but having the game being this close is still inexcusable. Turning the ball over and lazy offense was the reason the game went this way.
We deserved it w/ the shitty way we were playing.
I still have no idea how we got swept last year
He offers elite post defense, the ability to stretch the floor and great playmaking from the high post. Dwight/McGee couldn't do any of those.

I do miss Dwight's rim protecting ability and he definitely guarded the pick and roll better but honestly I'd rather have Gasol. Dwight didn't get that many minutes in the playoffs anyway and Gasol will be huge if we face the Nuggets or 76ers in the WCSF/WCF/Finals. 

McGee isn't even worth discussing. Significantly worse than both.
AD's so fucking weird. There's been so many possessions this year on defense where he could've gotten an easy block but he wouldn't even jump or put his arm up.
I don’t think any Lakers fan is looking at the positives after that disgusting performance, I feel like I need a bath.
Jokic and Embiid up there. Kinda too early to tell I think.
Idk how you had fun watching that shitshow but good for you I guess haha
They did the exact opposite actually.
refs are the reason you fucks even made it a game
Lakers played like shit in the 4th
no awards for playing the way they did this game...that was bad, except for caruso
How does someone type this out without feeling embarassed.
You should use this at an open mic night. Killer material
The nets have barely managed to beat some sorry teams as well.
Dwight yes

Rondo and Javale? No. Rondo was garbage all reg season and decent enough in the playoffs. Javale literally was unplayable 

Only mistake was gettin Harrell over Dwight for cheaper. Other than that, we’re good; just gotta lock in and get our team running an actual Offense properly again.
Well, this isn't our final form and we were expecting to coast like this before the season started. This was what they were talking about, we’ll be better ha.
Tell me when he has a clutch performance when his team is down. Can’t name a time
Since '89
I've felt this way since 2004 honestly.
Still got PTSD from 04.
I always wondered, do Lakers fans consider the Pistons a rivalry?

I admit I'm excited to see you guys doing well again, it seems like the only time Detroit can do well is by killing a Lakers dynasty.
I don’t want to get swept though.
I agree, but 23 turnovers is excessive and most teams would beat the Lakers at that number.
December 31, 2017 in Houston
January 29, 2015. Against the Bulls. Lakers won 123-118
and speed. Except for plumlee, the whole team is like they have jetpacks on their backs.
Caruso is legit one of the most important players on this team, but I understand limiting his minutes for now because we need him to go 110% down the line in the playoffs.

That big 3 came exactly when we needed him to make it and I love him so much for his massive leap in shooting this year.
Right after both Schroder and LeBron raged At Kuzma for being in the wrong position to start the offense. Caruso just has that iq that leads him to make very little mistakes.
Caruso to Lakers staff right before the start of overtime: "You fucking NEED me, Frank! You can't win without me!"
he started in a finals game too. which reminds me how he and FVV have the same trajectories.
Dude is extremely talented he’s just so inconsistent on offense, If he could ever just put it all together on offense on a pretty consistent basis he’d be a damn good player.
Probably at least partially because in the 4th quarter it was mainly grant on him but in ot they kept switching plumlee onto him
>flipped a switch

You can describe a decent amount of Laker games with just that phrase. They can be playing mediocre for a good chunk of the game and then just flip a switch and take over. Hell, they just did that against Denver on Thursday.
*50 million
That pass fake to Lebron was so delicious.
I wonder if he can keep it up on an increased volume. Also, that flair is sick. I haven't seen it before now.
That's for sure, but this team ain't playing for the regular season. They're playing to see Game 6 in the Finals Starter Caruso again. (And a championship, obviously)
I feel that. Sometimes it feels like they need a loss to snap them out of that bullshit. Sloppiest game I've seen in a while
i legit thought the pistons had an epiphany about who/what lebron's true kryptonite is--it confused me, too, lol
I'm dying at this comment lol
But the karma!!!
They didn't play tonight but the team's record is being held back by Blake and DRose. Neither have been good this year. The rest of the lion's share of minutes are going to scrappy replacement level starters + Grant.

I'm worried if we do move Blake and DRose, we'll go on a run and kill draft position. We're bad but without those 2, I think we're 30 win bad. I'd like to be 20 win bad.
Look at their few wins lol. Sixers, heat, Celtics , Suns, Lakers. They show up for the big dogs every so often.
No after credits scene either

No more OTs in LA

"Dont bother me, and I wont bother you"
Pretty sure AD cleaned up Lebron's brow during some time out. I mean literally. Saw it on my screen.
It's just so fucking good.
Presti might have something to say about that.
Honestly the NBA should adopt the NFL draft system and just give the number one pick to the worst record.
What is this willingness to switch Plumlee on Lebron 3-4 possessions in a row? Why bother putting your best wing defender on Lebron in the first place?
True... if you get a superstar in the making in the draft... this team can be the next cavs with Jeremi grant improving year after year.
The Laker way lol
Jackson was playing on a bum ankle. Expect to see more of this lol
Bad Boys + 04
Father time: LeBron I don't feel so good
To the Moon! 🚀
Skip Bayless would have definitely shorted that one but the price went stonks
$Bron stonks goes brrrrr
The multiverse
People have been saying he’s gonna take a backseat to AD since AD signed to the Lakers

That’s clearly not happening anytime soon
Instagram and Twitter think that he gets carried
Both him and AD sucked ass at the end of regulation. I was legit begging to see Dennis have the ball and take the shots
He obviously did that on purpose so he can do this in OT.
I don't know why they kept switching Plumlee on LeBron. It clearly wasn't working.
Its because I was watching, he always misses when I'm watching. I stopped watching when the Lakers were down 110-106 because I thought the Pistons were going to mop them up, then this happens.
[deleted]
Leborn Again
Lmao as soon as lakers got up he starts playing well. Most of his ‘clutch’ performances have been when the score was tied or they were up. Hardly when they’re down
Man can do whatever he wants until the playoffs start for me.

Lol
I know it sounds crazy to say he played poorly with that stat line but I just watched an entire game of every Piston driving past him and into him to score at the rim with ease, and Plumlee outhustling him for every loose ball while scoring over him. AD would not have allowed that to happen last season.
You are taking it too seriously bro :)
People who are vaccinated can still be a carrier of covid right? So it's probably still dangerous if not all players are vaccinated too
I wouldn't call the current lakers much worse. They definitely miss dwight on the defensive end but they have so much more options offensively. Before this game, they were the no. 1 defensive rating team so it's not like our defense is so much worse. The pistons are just a bad matchup for us this year. The lakers also have a tendency to play to the level of the opposing team.
Better in different ways. I don't think Dwight or Rondo would be very productive this year.
it's a joke dawg
Ben Wallace isn't walking through that door.
Right after that legendary 2018 playoff performance too. Those receipts could shame people into deleting their accounts if someone cared enough to look.
I know you're supposed to say "when he declines" but I'm really close to changing that to an "if" statement.
I was against him joining the Lakers because of a very short title window, and that all the young guys would be traded for a win now move.

Wanted the Laker young guys to get better and sign whichever star they can find with their big capspace.

Winning solves everything, and LeBron signing a rare extension and AD signing long term fixes that
Wait what? People said that? Lol
He is but that's part of the learning. Would've been happy with him fouling out if we could've gotten a few more possessions with him being a wrecking ball first.
What're your expectations for the squad, as a fan?
Think you mean the year before. We split it with them last year
He got a taste of being a champion and he thinks he can LeCoast. I'm not complaining, because we all know he can turn it on. If this coasting doesn't stop a month before playoffs though, that's a whole different story.
Season is 1/3 done.
Some of us love our NBA games like we love our women.

Wild, Trashy, and can go all night.
A trap game almost turned into a trap house. The LeFuckYou 3s at the end were hilarious though...
Pistons went hard against a bottom team
Yeah ok sure. The refs scored our 129 points.
i guess i’m mostly confused about who balled out for the pistons lol
Even if we blew them out like we should’ve there would’ve been no awards. I understand why because it’s expected, but your reason is dumb
When they have their full team this Lakers team will get destroyed. Got to get a real lob threat big who can defend.
Are you asking for times he made a shot while his team is down? He's made a shot to take the lead in the 4th quarter 535 times. https://stathead.com/tiny/RYzyw
Go to sleep nephew
Last night.
>Can’t name a time

Game 6 2013 finals: 16 points in the 4th on 7/11 shooting and finishes with a 30 point triple double in leading his team to a victory after trailing the spurs by double digits in the 4th. Game 7 2016 nba finals: scores 8 consecutive points to the the Cavs from down 81-87 to up 89-87.
3-1
Bro, way to bring back some bad memories p
I still hear "DEEEEEE-TROIT BAAAAAASKET-BALLL!" in my nightmares sometimes.
1989 for me.
It’s more of historical rivalry. My Dad and Grandpa definitely hated the 80s Pistons teams with a passion. Then it cooled off for over a decade until 04, and I learned how much I hated Tayshaun Prince, Rip Hamilton, Sheed Wallace, Ben Wallace, and Billups. Our rivalry will reignite again if we meet in the Finals and a new generation of Laker fans will learn to hate you guys again.
I wouldn't go as far as to say a "rivalry" in the way we're rivals with the Celtics and maybe Clippers now, but when both teams are good I always get a little bit excited for Lakers-Pistons just because of the history. It's one of those games that just pops a little bit more when I look at the schedule (same with the Spurs when they're good, even though pretty much all of the 2000s Spurs core is gone now)
Was that the game where Eric Gordon hit the three to send it to overtime?
Was that Kuzma's 38 pt game ?
Yup. That's another reason why they're the epitome of a trap game opponent every single time they take the court. They may be 5-18 now but they have a knack for going on stunning runs at any given moment against anybody.
Plumlee has hops man
It’s so underrated to have a guy that had to claw his way to just have a spot on an NBA team. Guys that got in the nba straightaway tend to take it easy on a night like this if it isn’t going their way because they’re so secure in their job
Meanwhile the contract Kuz got should have went to Caruso. *Shrug*
He was getting there this year until an ankle injury like 10 games in
Yeah it was three straight possessions that Bron cooked him. Really weird coaching by Dwayne Casey
Which is why I’m so glad the Nuggets no longer have Grant lol
The reason the pistons lost was because of the foul trouble on our 2 active centers. Couldn't be aggressive inside against AD in the later stages, and had to switch him to where it might make the most sense. I wouldn't have done it twice though.
Meh Nuggets lose pretty much every 3rd quarter doesn't matter if it's  Lakers or  Wolves 

3rd quarter splits are unseemly

https://i.redd.it/h8oqidopcxf61.jpg
You now have my attention
Preach. This year and 2023 are not the year to be prideful. Get a good pick and cap space.
You guys got a real one in Grant. He impresses me more every time I see him. Kinda looks like his uncle, too.
> Blake and DRose. Neither have been good this year.

Except last week against the Lakers of course.
They always play hard, so when a team underestimates them or tries to coast, the Pistons can make them pay.
Am I stupid for checking them at the end of every episode?
Yeah, about that...
LeBrondaVision
I saw it too
literally had no clue what was going on at first but couldn’t stop watching.
Shit is awesome, vision had me laughin my ass off it ep 2 during that magic show
Bruh give us Cade and you can have literally every other player in the first round lmao
don't ask me man, I'm not the coach. I think the real issue was that we only had 2 centers for the entire game, and both of them were put into foul trouble fairly early on into the game. I guess they weren't thinking Lebron was as big of a risk as AD was on the inside, and wanted plumlee to stay in the game no matter what. I don't know if I would have made the decision, and certainly not twice.
I'm down for it, would love to tune in for more Pistons games like this
Was he playing on a bum ankle his whole career?  Cuz damn he looked different this game lol.
LeBron: You’re too tired now, Father Time...too slow to drive past me....
LeOne Above All
He wants to but AD isn't performing.
It’s pretty clear this season AD is not that guy.
If AD actually was in shape he might defer more, just like he did last year during the regular season
Anyone that may have thought that has not even uttered something that silly after watching a few games this season lol.
Lmao, Bron is doing the carrying this season. I love AD but dude has been himself only 1 out of every 3 games this season. Lakers roster is talented enough where that hasn't been an issue
Why would you even read the comments over there, that's why I laugh when KD said fans are smarter nowadays lol
I don't get why they didn't let Schröder go to work. He was cooking out there. Frank's offensive schemes are sketchy.
and get his 5th rebound for the 15/5/5 record.
Lecalculated
He shot over him from stepbacks, who could've guarded it better??
I think it was working ok.  I don't know why they even care about a switch when he's just gonna take a stepback 3.
> regulation
My guy, he was the main reason they were up in OT. What an asinine comment. I’m sure you were ready to come out of the woodwork after regulation, so it must be tough for you after what he did in OT
How does that refute anything I said?

What player in this world is literally always clutch, makes damn near every shot when they're down? You're putting an unrealistic standard when no one else performs well when they're down too

He had a bad end to the 4th after playing many minutes straight with no rest because AD & company can't keep momentum & hold a lead. Vogel has no offense without LeBron runnin it and AD has fallen off so far
With 2:30 left in 2OT, the Lakers were down 122-121. LeBron scored 8 of the next 10 Lakers points to go up 131-124 and the remaining points for the Lakers were garbage time free throws. He also scored to tie the game with 46 seconds left in the first overtime. So, you're actually just completely wrong.
Yeah, probably true, still would love for him to take some more of the burden off 36 year old Lebron's shoulders. AD's in his peak years, he should be the one in the MVP discussions & LBJ the one coasting.
If this keeps going, LeBron is going to be dead by then
just hope he doesn't develop any bad habits
I'm aware, but I'm talking about the playoffs time in the early summer where we should hopefully be well into vaccinating the general public & the NBA players, coaches, staff, etc will already be vaccinated. Will probably only be half capacity w/ masks still encouraged at the very best, but it would be nice to go back to the old feel of the games w/ the energy of the crowd influencing action on the floor.
Isaiah Stewart is though 👀
People can be so stupid lol. The day he signed was one of the happiest of my life.
When Savannah says he can’t play anymore. That’s when everyone else is safe again.
One thing I've learned as a Cavs fan is never to bet against Lebron, as he is not human.
I think they should have had blake sub in for 10 hard minutes of Jordan Rules basketball.
Going into the season, I wasn't too high on the team as it was constructed on paper. As it stands now, I see the team being extremely competitive once Blake Griffin is off the payroll. My thoughts are that in 2 years, our current youngsters will be playing quite well, our "cheap" young fliers will be even better, we'll hopefully have a very good young player coming from the 21 draft, and we'll have lots of cap space to get the real difference makers that set the team over the top.
There’s a difference between coasting and lecoasting
Right. I think it’s hard when so much of it is based on where you are in the standings and everyone is still bunched so close together. A 3 game winning streak can move you up like 4/5 spots in the standings. I think it’s something people can really start to dig into around the all star break. But that’s just my opinion so who cares
You’re acting like you guys won lol
josh jackson is the second coming of mj x steph
Josh Jackson turned into Jesus and Jeremy Grant continues to be the Lakers killer
Let’s not forget that the full powered nets gave up 147 points and lost to the cavs. It’s insane to think that the lakers led by Lebron and ad would get destroyed by anyone at this point In the season
Don't worry we will beat the nets in the ecf
Yup but kyrie and ray allen ended up making the final shots off the Bron miss
Hopefully we’ll be a problem again soon
Nah, that was in January 2019
That game fucking hurt. Iirc Lonzo hurt his ankle in that game and was out for the season
Nah, he had 23 that game
5-18 but wins against the Lakers, Heat, Celtics, 6ers, and Suns
I’m rooting for him so hopefully this is the start of him turning it back around.
"Plum, you can guard an old man, right?"
why are we acting like those 3s Bron hit werent hard asf lol. Plumlee did all he could but greatness will always overcome
we need to guarantee a top 5 pick somehow
Coaching for a top 3 pick
I mean Lebron had no issue with him in playoffs
The Nuggets got killed in the 4th quarter against the Lakers as well.
Isn’t Horace Grant an identical twin?
Hell no, it's Marvel lol always let em roll to the end or fast forward on the slowest speed lmao
If there's one,  you'll see it on here.   My guess is that there will only be one at the end of the season
I don't think anyone did lmao but it's been explained really well and the storyline has only gotten better.
I reccomend everybody pick up the xmen arch book "House of M" which this is all based on. And cry because its so much more epic with all the Xmen in it, but marvel at how interestingly they adapted it for an episodic tv show. People at marvel are adapting masters.
Hell, I'd even take Mobley or Kuminga. Just please, I need a top-3 pick.
They already do
He was playing well for us at the start of the season. Hoping he's actually turning a corner here.
He’s had a good season for us. Started off great, got injured but is coming back into form.
He’s got a whole lot of talent and has improved his shot a lot, he shot really well from 3 in the G league last year and has improved in that area a ton, had some nice games for the grizz last year and was playing really well this year before hurting his ankle, he had some really nice games as a sun too his probably has always just been his incredibly inconsistent but his shot even if the % rt now don’t back it up is much improved.
Honestly idk if he wants to
AD hasn't been a top 10 player at all this season lol. Lebron is carrying this team hard offensively
it might be he's not properly conditioned this start of the season, league has seen what he can do last playoffs. He really needs to improve on reading the double teams.
Most likely reason I could think of is still trying to get AD back into shape. He's really a shell of himself right now
LeYes OT Tonight (2x)
Nah scored on a drive too. Grant was doing a pretty good job on him. No reason to switch that 3 times in a row.
He had two layups on him as well. As soon as I saw Plumlee come out to the 3 point line I was like no way they just did that.
[From one to another.](https://i.redd.it/n9p0ilnp6kf61.jpg)
For real. If Reddit's search function was any better I could find countless threads from each of the last 6 years questioning whether LeBron has finally reached a point where he declines as a player. I vividly remember all the hot-takes during LePotato month in 2014-15.
What about this season specifically?
hahaha wow. ty!
haha ok ok i see. thank u! congrats on the W
>Yup but kyrie and ray allen ended up making the final shots off the Bron miss

And? Bron did most of the work. The last shot is no more important than the first shot. LBJ had 16 in the 4th in 2013 game 6 and scored 11 of the Cavs 18 total points in 2016 game 7. He did the majority of the work. #Clutch #PutRespectOnHisName #CryYourselfToSleep #RentFreeInYourHead #FindAMoreLucrativeJobThanBeingAnLBJHater
So this year in the finals right? :)
Ingram was insane that game
Yep. Crazy how that was Lonzo's last ever game as a Laker
Bye
Same here man, I liked the pick when y’all got him and he’s a Detroit native so I’ll always root for him no matter the team.

Just made a lot of bonehead decisions but it looks like he’s matured a lot so I’m sure he’ll keep improving from here.
Old Man James: And that's when I took it personally
Plumlee always getting highlights scored on him tho
He has developed quite a lot since then in my opinion
Yea
I saw the first couple episodes and thought, this aint for me. But i read the last episode changed everything so im going back in.

edit: just saw ep 4. Here we go. Much different
That's why you peruse /r/MarvelStudios and various youtube breakdowns so that smarter nerds can explain everything and all the lore and backstory lol
I mean he definitely wants to take a back seat in terms of scoring. He wants to be the facilitator but he can't when AD is barely averaging 20 and he forgot how to shoot free throws.
he is able to rely more on other players though to fill the AD gap. Kuz, Schroeder and THT have all upped their game
LeBron needs to whoop his ass.
Mostly talking about the 3s, but I know what you mean down low.  I didn't see if Lakers were hunting the switch or if Pistons chose it
He tried haha
I'm slightly worried once the season gets going and the schedule balances out to be a bit more in our favor, we might be playing too good for our own good. But If Griffin plays in games and we trade rose, I'm not worried at all about that. The players who will be here for years to come will keep playing with each other, the youngsters will continue to develop, and all will be right in the world. I'm considering buying some season tickets rn, that's how I'm feeling about the state of the franchise at this moment.
Ya I agree def looks like he’s matured, I’ll always root for him because of how hard he played, dude played harder than everyone pretty much every night.
emergency awesome is my go to for all comic breakdowns and easter eggs if anyone needed a recommendation
He'd loooove it.

The Knicks:

- Have won seven of their last nine games. 

- Are currently the 4 seed in the East. 

- Have ensured at least a .500 record through the halfway point of the season. 

This is easily the best Knicks team since 2012.
To the RJ is a bust crowd: it's okay to be wrong
YERRRRRRRRRRRRR
If we're this annoying being one game above .500, imagine us after the 3peat
THE KNICKS ARE ABOVE .500
7-3 since the Rose trade, 3-0 since starting em..them bois is BALLIN
How is thibs not being considered for COY. Ranked as 3rd worst team and now they are the 4 seed. This is a total turn around of the team.

You aren't seeing things.  It is almost March 1st and the Knicks have more wins than losses.
Adam Silver should’ve blocked the DRose trade for league parity
THE NEW YORK KNICKS WILL BE IN SOLE POSSESION OF 4TH PLACE IN THE EAST ON MARCH 1ST
Frank Ntilikina with a LiAngelo

1 steal, goose eggs elsewhere
This feels like a dream.
Couldn't imagine being a poverty franchise
I don’t know what the specifics were but the Knicks shot like 75%-80% FG in the 2nd half lmao, that’s fucking wild. I don’t get what was good with Thibs playing the starters the whole 4th quarter when they’re up 20, on a fucking back to back. Gotta love when we have almost 7 guys in double digits tho. RJ was smoooooth tonight, so fucking strong inside. Trading DSJ for DRose was way more than worth it lmao.
KNICKS ARE THE FOUR SEED YEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
CAN I GET A YERRRRRRRRRRRRR

Amazing
####WE'RE OVER .500!!  WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
I cannot wait for the garden to open again holy shit.
Wont the pistons be disappointed when the mavs win the 2021 draft lottery and the knicks get cade
The 2020/2021 Knicks are the greatest team of all time and nothing will convince me otherwise.

Y'all don't want us in the 1st Round

just a solid game overall for us, hopefully we can walk away with 2 more wins before the all-star break
4th seed in the East babyyyy
Noel with 3 steals, blocks and 11 boards.
I really hope Knicks make playoffs. They’re a fun team
The Knicks are getting incredibly powerful. I for one welcome it.
If Peyton comes back to the starting lineup some maniac is going to burn MSG to the ground.
We’re above .500 YEERRRRR

YYYYYYEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Someone who posts clips has to get that rose  touch pass Noel dunk on here.
I wanna see a Knicks vs Nets Playoff series just for the sheer morbid curiosity of the game threads.
Blew the Pistons out by 19 with the refs riding them. Absolutely beautiful
Yerrrrrrrrr in the chat bois , give me a yerrrrrrr
YERRRRRRR
There just gritty as hell, fight every possession. Good culture they are building
I’m pretty disappointed we didn’t play the bench guys at the end, but overall a great win
Are the Knicks good or is everyone just really bad? Seriously, I haven’t watched much this year
Don’t watch any knicks games so I’m surprised to see Noel averaging so many minutes. Is this just a lack of C on the Knicks or is he actually a solid role player now? I’m assuming he’s filling a role similar to Tyson Chandler
Break up the Knicks
much more watchable too, it never feels like we're out of any games and choking away leads isn't a foregone conclusion
>This is easily the best Knicks team since 2012.

And we have a young core, cap space, and all of our draft picks, including the Mavs first rounder.  We're in a MUCH better place than we were then.
2012 New York Mavericks mercenary team didn't feel like a Knicks team. This one does.
That team was great. But they were old and you knew it wasn’t going to last. And that team you also knew wasn’t gonna beat lebron. 

This team is fun, a bit more Knick like, young and it feels like the beginning of something.
[deleted]
the NBA is way more fun when the Knicks are good
Pretty wild that if the season ended today, the Knicks would be hosting a first round series
*2013
SELL THE TEAM!

So anybody yelling that ?
They've moved on to "IQ has hit the rookie wall"
Shooting 40% from 3 in the past 20 games or so, the haters mad quiet
His rookie season was actually solid and he deserved to make all rookie team over Terrence Davis
Tell that to my dad who says the Knicks should trade him for Beal.  "Why the hell would the Wizards do that if you think RJ is garbage?", I ask.  "Idk but do it."
Dudes still not old enough to drink and these fools want to write him off,lol.
Yeah I never got that point. I always said his first year was bad but he clearly has star potential IMO.
Bro..I thought you were talking about Richard Jefferson and was confused as hell for a minute
I think he just got wrote off, not called a bust. Because of the implication.

YES YES YES

I’m definitely down for taking turns with that 4th seed, good luck for the rest of the regular season!
Blessed statline.
Still +1 though
The only 1 I care is the 1 we add to our win total!
10 min as a bench guard with quickly isn’t gonna lead to lots of counting stats.
In a road game no less, a pure LiAngelo
And don’t forget it was an away game too. An official Lamelo
Not too far off - 26 of 37, or 70% from the field in the second half
Woah how do I get this purple text
I feel like this team would be so fired up that they'd have a good chance of taking it to the eastern conference semis. Imagine the defensive intensity on every single trip.

never get old
don't worry bro i won't snitch on you
https://i.imgur.com/bDsfmdI.jpg
Knicks are good
Our other centers, Mitchell Robinson and Taj Gibson, are currently hurt. Robinson was the starter. Noel off the bench. Once Robinson got hurt, Noel began to start and Gibson came off the bench. But now Gibson got hurt early the previous night.aganst the pacers.
Also we can comfortably beat out worse teams, as we proved tonight.
An elite defense will keep us in games even when our offense isn’t clicking. That being said, our offense has been much better with Elfrid out because it lets randle/rose take the playmaking role and leave space for RJ to work (who would’ve thought?). I really think this team could do some damage if the offense got some help. Whether it comes from just the growth of our players, nailing the draft again, or even managing to secure someone in free agency. This really looks like a team that could compete for a while with our prominent players being quite young
Agree, I’m actually watching games and not sick during them. We honestly let a few games slip away late this year, we could easily have a few more wins.
Completely agree. I like this team more than the 2012 team. This team I feel like actually care and like playing together. They put in effort on defense and pass a lot more. Makes the games more enjoyable
It did and it didn’t. It was great to have the corpses of Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby on the roster, but yeah they definitely didn’t play Knicks style basketball and we all knew this team didn’t have long term potential.
You think this team can beat Lebron?
Man y’all smoking, seeing Jason Kidd pass to jr to dunk, jr being wildly amazing, melo and jr obliterate anyone and then Tyson tip out.
Don’t forgot Rasheed Wallace for like 16 games and I’man 
2013 Knicks was a blur and a super awesome party
Man I’m going with that 2012-13 team being more exciting. The vibe of that year was crazy
Fuck any 12-13  slander. I had more fun watching a team that I felt could win the NBA  finals over watching Jeremy Lin have a few good weeks. 

Much more nostalgia for them than linsanityb
Can’t say I’ve ever seen it before so I couldn’t tell you
still finished with 12 despite missing his first 5 shots
that and complaining about Thibs. i’ve never seen a group so full of dumb hot takes in an easy 20pt blowout night lmao.
"IQ can't even carry a team 30 games into his career, what a fucking scrub"
its 50% but you were close
I mean, Barrett has been good but I remember when the "haters" also crushed Kevin Knox and Frank Ntilkina and well....
The crazy thing is Anthony Edwards has such a similar stat line to RJ's rookie season and I bet he makes one of the teams this year
I think he only just surpassed 82 games played
No it wasn't, he put up numbers because he received big minutes on a bottom feeder.  His efficiency was terrible.  I'm a Knicks fan and I'm fine with him not making it. He was 19, but that shouldn't factor in him making the all rookie team.  The whole season was a solid learning experience, he flashed but was mostly mediocre at best.
Jeez, does your dad call into the Michael Kay show saying the Knicks should acquire Chris Paul because "they have the money to get him"
I mean, that trade is interesting. Beal is a heckuva player.
Nah, he didn’t say he was talking about a clown.
Plenty of people, some Knicks "fans" included, were adamant that he was a bust. If you look at just his shooting splits from his rookie season I guess I can see where you get that idea but I watch his games and I've always been confident that he's got star power.
This just isn't true. 

There was literally a post that topped r/NBA about him airballing two threes in a row in preseason. People been ragging on him ever since he got into the league.
$$$YERRRRR
YERRRRR
[It’s New York lingo ](https://youtu.be/9GIt9k5G9Ps)
2nd one would suggest you losing at least 1 after the 1st 3 peat. Not happening
The 4th one
We agree.
YERRRRRR
and s/o to Detroit too, still shocked all they wanted in exchange for D Rose was DSJ
Everyone is talking about Snyder as if it’s already his. No consideration for thibs

randles revenge part 1 through 4
Can't wait to see Randle take the crown from LeBron
Knicks vs Lakers finals would be the most toxic game thread ever and I’m here for it
Yall would hentai fuck them. It would be like LeBron vs Toronto 10X let's just let them enjoy a tough out in the second or something
Frank Ntilikina highlights - 0 points, INSANE steal
Oui
Hot damn we littttt
With the home fans at the Garden as well....
as long as austin rivers is on the team elfrid knows he wont be the first person cut
As long as you guy keep playing good defense like this and the FO look like they are competent enough, there will be some stars who would like to try his luck in New York. There are only so many max level contract slot in the league after all.
No. I mean... I could imagine it. But I have imagined them winning every year of my life. But no. 

However this team is young and has room to grow. That team did not.
The Tyson tip out. Man would be the only person within 5 feet of the basket and still top the ball back out to Melo.
also steve novak, elite 3 point sniper
My hot take is linsmaity wasn’t even the best Knicks stretch of basketball in its own decade. It was amazing but it’s overrated when compared to 12-13.
can't disagree with that either, that was the one season where I felt the team could win games on a nightly basis and we had a lot of good chemistry
Those back to back 3s were awesome, especially the sidestep one. It felt like he realized he wasn't showing up on the stat sheet so he stepped up to close the game.
Have mercy!
What does that have to do with anything?
I mean Frank did help massively in our game against the Pacers on the defensive end.
Knox and Frank have never done anything remotely impressive at the NBA level though
Neither have turned 23, but feel free to write them off as well.
Similar? Edwards’ is considerably worse at the moment
Only because he has more bleacher report highlights unfortunately lmao

Also it kinda went against the “LOL Knicks” narrative
Yes it was. He was solid for a rookie on a team with absolutely no spacing or direction. Don’t be disingenuous
Idk man.  Just be happy he isn't managing a team because he'd make David Kahn look like Pat Riley.
The great thing is that the knicks, while flawed, have enough solid young assets to make a big trade and still have a solid core.  That's something you could not say before this season. I'd rather stay the course, pray we stay healthy and add a solid free agent.
Because people want him to fail for the jokes about the Knicks picking a bust. Kid has the perfect mentality to be a Knick though. Doesn’t seem to be influenced by what anyone says
You don’t think air balling two threes in a row is going to draw some criticism?

As a neutral fan on this, RJ just never gets brought up. He doesn’t get called a bust because he doesn’t get any substantial attention.
The year gap is when they go win a superbowl with eli coming out of retirement to beat cyborg brady
2nd three-peat starts after the NBA is forced to cancel a season and rethink the sport after the Knicks go undefeated 3 years in a row.
Frank will take the year off so he can be a beach volleyball player so we'll take it easy until he comes back.
YERRRRRRRR
Tbh it was a pretty solid trade for what its worth. D Rose wanted to spend his remaining years trying to contend and we are no where near trying to contend. Also gives DSJ a chance to revitalize his career with both Hayes and Delon out at out PG positions. Even if he doesnt pan out hes getting another opportunity.
We need a PG and we are trying to run down the T-Wolves.  He brings great value in those areas.
And a second round pick was the big one. D Rose wasn't coming back next year and it was unlikely he would fetch more than a second with how he was in Detroit. Also they wanted to put him where he wanted to go
Generally COY goes to the coach who takes his team unexpectedly to the top. Generally 50 wins (in a normal season). So odds are against Thibs. But I feel like his name is mentioned in most conversations.
I mean Snyder is pretty likely, but the Jazz are already good last year. Thibs has turned the Knicks around and deserves serious consideration if they continue to tend upwards
RIP Mase :(
anythings possible, like anthony davis' legs could spontaneously fall off
Some People get touchy if you don’t praise linsanity. Like yea I enjoyed the moment. I was in college at the time, we watched the games in the dorm lounge area. Great time, for real. But that 12-13 team is different. The energy and confidence of that year was crazy. Like it was cool (always will be IMO) to be a real Knicks fan. Especially during that 13 game win streak
He's basically averaging a step back 3 per game. I've grown to expect it and yet I lose my shit every time it happens.
* Knicks 1st Round picks have typically been very bad
* The Knicks finally got 1 that looks pretty solid

Y'all don't defend Frank and Knox anymore cuz you know they're bad. "Haters" weren't blinded by fan optimism to dismiss their flaws from the start. I think RJ's prolly gonna end up being a solid scorer but not All-Star caliber. We'll see how good his 3pt shooting is the rest of the year, given how poor it was at the start.
I feel like if you told Knicks fans after the 2017 NBA Draft that their future PGs stat-line for his career entering his 4th season was 6PPG, 3.0APG, 2.1RPG, on .370 / .318 / .778 splits - they wouldn't care how good his defense is.
I was trying to be nice haha
I respect your opinion, and agree about the spacing and pg problems.  Inefficient all around, those problems had no effect on his horrid performance from the charity stripe. You call it solid, I'll call it average, and I don't even need to look at the advanced metrics to know what kind of picture they paint.
Exactly this.
Next year he's going to put it all together and go off.
Two air balls in a preseason game tho bruh? It's one thing to airball in a game that matters, but read the comments in that thread there. That's all you need to know.

Taking a talented team with 2 all stars to the one seed isn’t as impressive as thibs taking a historically bad team that everyone thought wouldn’t sniff the playoffs to home court advantage
> Y'all don't defend Frank and Knox anymore 

We don't defend Frank anymore? lmfaoo alright you definitely don't know what you're talking about
It’s literally too early to come to any conclusion like that. You sound snobby and obnoxious. He’s literally 20, let’s look at how Jaylen Brown and Brandon Ingram were doing at that age in the league. Also, his 3 point shooting is fine, it’s literally the same percentage as your boy
He’s 20. All I’m gonna say. He may not be an all star but his improvements from last season are a great sign for his development. All star potential is definitely there. He has 6 years until he’s 26... where a player like Julius Randle got his first all star appearance.
It definitely helps that the team is somewhat competent on the offensive end now, so that frank's offensive output is ignorable. Still wouldn't have drafted him over Donovan Mitchell.
He's one of the worst statistical offensive players in the league.. couldn't get a basket tonight in 13 minutes...Frankstans can be insufferable.
“I respect your opinion even though I downvoted you” hahaha good one buddy. 

In all seriousness, he wasn’t a good shooter, I never claimed he was. Spacing impacted his ability to do what he does best and that’s getting to the rim and drawing fouls. Most rookies have bad advanced metrics, especially rookies on trash teams.
You know you have a bad take when you have a Celtics fan arguing for a Knicks player against you
I feel like both are impressive.
Not only that. They’re playing how everyone expected them to last year. I’m not even being bias as a Knicks fan. Everybody thought the jazz would be way better last year.
Frank provides the defense himself
My bad, the homerism is worse than I thought if there are some people still caping up for him.
Jaylen Brown's growth has legit stunned me. I did not expect him to ever become a 25PPG caliber player.

We'll see. It's just an intuition bro. FWIW, I don't think Herro is a future All-Star either. At least not consistent as in a 3x, 4x, 5x All-Star. Could they get in on an off year the way Goran Dragic did 1 year? Sure, not really what I'm referring to.
Isn't that how it works? You down vote when you don't agree, no?
Again, I thought he just wasn't good enough to be on the rookie team.
Imagine trying to go at another teams homerism when you're part of a fanbase that didn't want to trade Herro for Harden because "culture"
You can replace Jaylen Brown’s name with like 4 other players in that statement. Look at Deandre Hunter for example, no one predicted he could become the shot creator he is now, isolating on the below and hitting midrange shots consistently. He’s easily the 3rd best rookie from the 2019 draft so far, he’s 23 though. Point being is that it’s way too early and way too soon to be making definitive statements. 
RJ is 20 and has barely played 82 games. He’s averaging over 16 ppg with a mediocre handle, mediocre jumpshot and mediocre finishing and yet somehow, gets wherever he wants and makes excellent pick and roll reads. 
It’s perfectly fine for Knicks fans to be optimistic about his career and it was completely unfair how people in this sub and NBA fans in general trashed him early on in his career which is what Knicks referring to “haters” are saying. It was blatant how much people wanted him to fail, that’s not homerism it’s just the truth
No lol that’s not how it works, technically. You can do whatever you want, but downvoting is supposed to be for this according to Reddit:

>If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

Basically BS comments get downvoted. Regardless, if you respect my opinion you wouldn’t have downvoted it.
I mean, 1) I ain't in that camp. If you coulda got Harden for Herro + you would do it.

2) There's about a 500x better argument for not doing that than still defending Frank. Like, the simplest way to put it is think of other 1st round picks who's career average PPG is 6.0 entering their 4th season that is viewed as a good player. There's nobody you could name you'd honestly think of as a good asset / player. It's like 76ers fans bizarre obsession over-rating Matisse Thybulle.
> Point being is that it’s way too early and way too soon to be making definitive statements.

Sometimes yes and sometimes no.

Listen, the greatest thing about the young players is that they can literally be anything. Any flashes instantly get the fanbase hyped up and any flaws or detracting elements can be waved away with "he's young", "he's inexperienced", or "he'll develop that with time". In some cases, yes - that's fair, but A LOT of fanbases do it with their crappy young players because what else are they gonna do but hope? There are so many busts that get defended for years when they've proven they're not any good.

Dragan Bender is entering his 4th NBA Season. He's still only 22. Is anybody thinking he still has potential to be an All-Star despite being the 4th pick? No, of course not. Suns fans moved on from him so he doesn't get defended anymore. 

How about the vast majority of the 2015 1st Round. Remember the Mudiay hype with Denver? OR Stanley Johnson with Detroit? OR Heat fans going nuts with Winslow? For years it was "he can develop his 3pt shot like Kawhi did once he got to the pros" or "he sucks at finishing the rim as a rookie, he'll get better with time". Bro, I watched 90% of Winslow's games, he stayed a BAD finisher at the rim for those full years.

This is NOT an indictment against RJ. He's already doing 10x more than most rookies that are true busts, his WORST case scenario at this point is being an inefficient scorer who doesn't develop but still gets buckets. The jokes at his expense are in-part due to the fact the Knicks fell to 3rd in the lottery with Zion/Ja. We'll see how good he pans out, but if I had to guess, those other two dudes have All-NBA potential and... like I said, we'll see with RJ.
Good to know, thanks.
one fluke finals appearance and you become the most unbearable fanbase in all of sports
Knicks fans would literally burn down the entire Northeast for a fluke Finals appearance, and it'd be worth it bro - it's so much fun seeing your team go far in the playoffs, y'all should try it sometime.
thank you for proving my point
Bro why are you arguing with him. His team has CULTURE bro
Pelle, a New York legend.
Norvel Pelle blocked two shots AFTER breaking his finger. I love this dude.
That closing lineup was filthy. Theo Pinson, Jared Harper, Frank Ntilikina, Kevin Knox, Norvel Pelle 🔥
KEEP NORVEL PELLE FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON
Honestly even when watching the game, seeing a score like this and realizing we’re the winning team is sort of surreal as a Knicks fan.

Certainly not complaining though!
Great to see Obi playing better
Norvelle pelle szn
Sorry Pistons you had to feel the wrath of a team that just lost to the T-Wolves
You can tell we were angry about the 3 game losing streak and let some of that anger out tonight. Sorry it had to be you Piston bros. GG
i don’t know what’s crazier, watching the Knicks win a game by 40 or not seeing Randle and RJ in the game during the final 2 minutes of a 40 point win
Pistons fans deserve the first pick in the draft
The Knicks won by 44. ??

You read that right.

The Knicks won

by 44.

YERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
thankfully we didn't choke the lead this game (we had double digit leads against the Heat, Timberwolves and Mavs before completely collapsing during the 2nd half), going against the Nets/Celtics/Grizzlies this week is gonna be a tough task and realistically we should at least have been a few games over .500 going into Sunday
Man I really hope NY makes playoffs
Pelle working for that contract.
pelle is already a certified goat..... resign him asap
[deleted]
Corner kev 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
YERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Tfw we up by 30 with 7 min left in the game and we playing rose and gibson
Hayes has a great feel for the game. He’ll be a scary playmaker when his shots start falling. It’s good to see Toppin looking more comfortable in his past couple of games. I wasn’t the highest on him, but I’m still rooting for him.
Great bounce back result
Playing the Detroit Pistons is like a mental health day for NBA teams
Man, there are some bad teams in the league this year
Are we finally off the Jerami Grant bandwagon? Dude is exactly who we thought he was going to be on the Pistons. An inefficient number one option putting up better counting stats but less impact compared to his time on the Nuggets.
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be.
[deleted]
Noel is on the knicks and starting too? Had no idea. I thought he was on the bench in OKC still.
[deleted]
re-sign him right fucking now Leon
Step aside Pelé, a new Pellé is here
Wait he had 3 rebounds, 2 blocks and no fouls? League fucked
Seeing him get injured on a 10-days sucks man
the G league special
Big 5.
we might considering our depth atm
He has some pretty good moves going to the hoop now, but like Clyde says he's too team focused and looks more to give the ball up to a teammate before his own shot. He's gotta learn sometimes he's gonna be the best option to score and look at the rim more
Don't worry, that outcome is perfect for us!
When was the last time the Knicks were 2 wins or losses from .500? I swear this team teeters on the average like a man on a high wire.
Do you, we’re tankin
Surprisingly as fucked up as it is, pistons never even moved up in the draft.... lakers can move up three straight tries but pistons never moved up once.... Random lottery tho🤷🏻‍♂️
L vs. Nets, W vs. the Boston Small Dicks, W vs. Memphis. Heard it here first.
We’re winning all three.

Yerrrrr
We're all but locked for the play-in, but would prefer a 4/5 seed
Thibs paranoid as hell after we blew double digit leads to the Wolves (2x) and the Mavs this week lol
Pistons aren’t this bad normally. Knicks just caught fire early and ended it in the first.
Have you seen the team around him? He has considerably improved, it’s not his fault he’s playing with a bunch of rookies
He’s coming down because his team mates aren’t there yet. He’s clearly an improved player with room to grow more.
Stat watcher alert everybody
So you're saying he's rookie Mitchell Robinson?

We can fix him, we have the technology.
one of the greatest big men in Nets history
bruh what’s with the injuries right now? he broke his finger?
They were 24-22 before the 3 game losing streak so 4 games ago
Trust me I know what feels like to tank, but to see your team lose by 40 still stings
[deleted]
I'd gladly take that though I really hate losing to the Nets tbh
Harden and KD are both out. There’s no reason we should lose to the nets, but I’ve been watching this team long enough to know we probably will
nah tbh all it takes is a long losing streak and we might be out of the picture of 10th; and considering our collapses in the 4th quarter the last few games, I'm genuinely worried about how we will fare against Western Conference teams. Indiana, Boston, Chicago and Toronto are right behind us and they just need any sort of winning streak to get back in the picture of 6th to 8th.

As for the play-in, other than missing out of 10th overall, it would honestly be a worst case scenario if we finish 7th-10th, losing that game would be exactly the same as missing the playoffs and with our terrible offense I don't feel confident we can actually outscore teams in a do-or-die like the play-in. Hopefully we can try to finish 4th to 6th in the East but that depends if we can pick up wins against teams like the Nets, Mavs and Suns in the upcoming weeks.
Yeah I think this was lowkey like punishment for the bench/2nd unit.
Heat as well to a lesser extent
I mean he’s 27. I don’t think he’s really going to change much more as a player in terms of being able to carry a team. I’m not saying he isn’t better or improving but I think he’s turning out exactly how many people thought he would. I think he would have continued to improve on the Nuggets as well.

I don’t think the Pistons will ever make the playoffs with Grant as the number one option let alone make a deep run into the playoffs. There’s nothing wrong with his decision because he did what was right for him but a lot of ppl were really hyping him up early on because of his solid start but I just don’t see him being anything more than a tank commander if he’s the #1 or even #2.
Don’t know the specifics but his finger was pointing to the side so dislocated for sure
Holy shit, that is actually tragic.
After that you probably deserve it LOL.
No lol as tragic as that is they just didn’t move down that was their original spot, but Darko was still horrible
Indeed but I’d actually hate losing to the Small Dicks even more since we’re battling for playoff seeding with them, which is absolutely hilarious. We’re almost 3/4s of the way through the season and Brad Stevens, Jayson Tatum, and Jaylen Brown are looking up in the standings at Tommy Thibodeau, Julius Randle, and Reggie Bullock. 

#BUCK FOSTON
Gotta disagree, the bench was the only reason the Mavs game was close for as long as it was. If it was a punishment thing, he would have made Randle, RJ, and Bullock play 40 tonight
Nobody expected him to be a number one but on Denver he was seen as just a fourth/fifth slotted guy and with his already elite defense and now expanding offensive game, he has proven to be considerably better than projected.
Idk what more specifics you want, we saw the play, we saw his finger sticking the wrong way, then we saw the trainer fix it, and we saw him playing basketball after.
I’d argue we’re still feeling the consequences of that draft, it set us back so damn much. 

Also you’re so lucky you have Devin Booker ... I was SCREAMING for us to take him in the draft, he’s literally a Pistons fan from Michigan, and we fuckkn took Stanley Johnson 😭
I don’t see how he’s been better than expected. He was absolutely expected to be the #1 on Detroit. Who was supposed to be the #1 going into this season? What we’re the expectations for him coming in as Pistons fan making $20 mil a year?
Yeah but there could be muscle tears, broken bones, etc.
Many people judged and laughed at him for taking this chance and by all accounts everybody was surprised at how well he has performed. He’s far from a tank commander seeing as Boston really wanted him after his first half performance
How can you say he’s far from a tank commander? The Pistons are in last place in the East. I think everyone expected him to score more points on worse shooting and maybe some more assists and worse defense.
He’s not Ricky Davis. No player in the league swaps with him and makes this current team a playoff team. He was just the third best player on a western conference team a year ago. Once the team improves his ability will improve even more
Yea I think there are maybe 3-4 guys that could carry this team to a 7/8 seed in the East. That’s not the point I’m making. The point is that Grant scoring 22 points per game on below average efficiency is about what everyone expected. I don’t think we really know that much more about Jerami Grant that we didn’t know from his time on the Nuggets. Name one team in the East where you swap him with the #2 and that teams championship chances increase? The Knicks maybe? And they’re still a first round exit probably.

Edit: Hawks probably improve a little as well but still are not sniffing a deep playoff run. Point being he doesn’t move the needle as anymore more than a #3 on a playoff team which was exactly his role on the Nuggets.
Norman Powell with the casual 14/3/2/3/2 on 50% shooting... loving this pickup he's such a hustle player. Hopefully the Raps are enjoying GTJ half as much as I love Powell.
Roco is your favorite player's favorite player. He is truly a god among men.
First win in Detroit in 6 1/2 years
The healthy Blazers have the potential to be an average defensive team
DAMIAN LILLARD.
So is Diallo for real?
Blazers are my west team i hope dame wins mvp
If I didn't even have my butt clenched the entire 4th quarter, was it really a Blazers game?
Still undefeated in the Norman Powell era
I will always have love for Hami, seems like a pretty solid player. Happy for him
Only 2 wins by double digits in March and they came at the beginning and end of the month!
Its official. Blazers are poverty. Only poverty teams beat the pistons.
51/53/92 splits for the Blazers? Fucking hell
Why the fuck is Carmelo Anthony getting 3 more shots than Norman Powell and 3 more minutes than DJJ.
1) We still need to figure out how to get Powell the ball more.  He's CLEARLY the 3rd best scorer

2) Underwhelming statline from Nurk.  What's not underwhelming is them only scoring 101 points.  

3) Covington has turned into a flamethrower

4) Whoever posted that Grant has been struggling..
Detroit Smashed!
[Yay!](https://i.imgur.com/N0FvZRK.gif)
Love Roco, dude puts in work!
Yo portland, let's meet at 4-5 and let the lakers clippers fight at 3-6 in the first round
People be giving Melo props for adjusting his game,but he hasn’t made a huge adjustment. He just comes off the bench.
Does Charles still have a bet on Portland to win it all?
The UConn women could defeat that trash Pistons lineup. The NBA should force the owners to sell if that is the kind of G-league roster Detroit is going to field.
GTJ currently has 23 points, 5/8 from three - I think they're enjoying him so far.
to put it bluntly, Norm was not known for his defense on this team

him having 3 steals and 2 blocks is mindblowing
Wait really? 



damn
can't have shit in Detroit!
Was that when dame hit the game winner?
That’s all we want. Give us average!
I wonder if the Blazers finally have a positive net rating after this game
Relax it’s the Pistons lol
Looks pretty legit to me. On a team with no shooters he makes getting to the rim look easy as hell. I can confidently say the Pistons have never had an athlete like him in my lifetime. His first step is insane. And his jumper looks alot more fluid than I'd expect from a career <30% shooter. Glad the trade is working out for both teams.
That blocked three was nasty
he's a bit of a douche but very industrious. Hat tip but no clap from me.
We got shootas
Jones bricked some real bunnies tonight at the rim of all places. Melo was off, but a lot of his look were when the defense had killed the play we wanted to run.  

It's ugly sometimes but you gotta roll with the ups and downs because he can single handed bring us back into games [ie Denver game]
Idk if it's just me, but I felt like Melo played really selfishly at some points tonight. There were definitely instances where he could've passed it to a player with a clean look three or midrange shot but instead choose contested layups all night
my complaint too lol might seem dumb because it was a good game from him scoring wise, but he shouldn't be second in field goal attempts for the team (which he was up until like 4 minutes left).

also jones should start and norman should come off the bench for scoring and finish games; beginning of games norm is kinda just out there in the corners not being used (maybe it's cause he doesn't know all our "plays" yet tho, it's only been 3 games)
Powell/RoCo are taking a lot of DJJ minutes because Stotts continues to play Simons way more minutes than he should.  Should just have only Dame/CJ/Powell getting guard minutes
We’re trying to keep everyone happy, and more importantly, healthy. This stretch of the season is going to be crazy. We gotta play our guys.
IsoMelo, 21 seconds on the clock, jacks up a three or corner fadeaway. Not mad at him tho.
I understood that reference
You bet your handsome ass we are 🤘
His hot shooting is the only thing keeping us in this game against Tanklahoma City. Because we're that bad at rebounding and OKC has like 20 offensive rebounds.
Mild take: We will always regret trading away our 6'6 SG that could play decent defense and get buckets at only 22 years old.
It really does say something that he's instantly become the best defensive guard on the team 😂 Not that the competition was that fierce
Bro that's an overstatement. Hes always been solid defensively, it's just tough to give a ton of effort on defense when your also expected to drop 25-30 every night like the last couple of months.

I'd say he's a solidly above average defensive player.
Yep, last win was December 9, 2014
Weird. My parents said the same thing to me this morning.
Nope
we had a postive net rating for a while and then we got blown out by like 35 points lmao
So close. Only -0.2
Haha yeah, for me it’s more of a hometown thing we r from the same neighborhood so that’s y i got love for him
But at least when DJJ is off with his shot he's still providing defense and effort. What the fuck does Melo bring to the table if he's not hitting his mid range fadeaways?
He always plays selfishly unforunately
its melo..
Nephews will be fooled with his stat line but won't realize that he made 3 of those shots off leak outs and a transition pass to him for an easy layup. Melo looked atrocious tonight and has looked bad since Powell came over. It's like he's taken it as a personal slight that Powell is here to take some of his shots. Like no Melo, Powell gets Gary/Rodney's shots, NOT YOU.
I really think Powell is just too good to not start. He unlocks so many more offensive options and the bench needs additional defense next to Melo and Kanter
With the schedule coming up I think it’s more important we play everyone we can and try to stay healthy
Norman Powell is a better defender. It's obvious watching the games and it's supported by the stats. GTJ by comparison was statistically a terrible defender for us, like a significant net negative.
Also hard to to look that great when you have all defence caliber guards and wings up and down the roster beside you
And you know what, you failed them...because you're great and nowhere near average!
That Mavs game kinda fucked our net rating
getting to the free throw line essentially. If the play breaks down we need to cook up something. PIstons were playing us pretty tight on the edges so wasn't always easy to run plays.  

I think Melos earned the opportunity and a longer leash to be our bail out option of the bench. He wasn't perfect by any stretch but gotta take the bad with the good. Obviously the guys respect him a lot too.
I.. I don't think that's the case at all. Feel like you're reading too much into it. Melo been playing the same he has all year, yall just want to see Norman go off which is fine but it's also silly to expect given that he just got here last week
I'm pretty sure he has the start. But he rarely shares the court with Dame and CJ past the opening few minutes
Seriously... Dame and CJ play so many minutes, I wish we could rest them more. Have them play about 30 min a night.
Ya I've noticed he sticks to his own man too much. Maybe it's partly from learning a new system tho
Nah, I'm his parents, we definitely think he's below average. Faaar, far below average.
They don't treat him like a bailout option tho. I swear there are like 3 times a game he will have the slightest mismatch  and dame or CJ will walk the ball up and throw it to him for a 40% iso look.
It's worth trying to see if he can heat up as well. Coaches will get guys to double him still and his ast to pass % leads the team in March. He is making better plays.  

I don't think this was his best game by any stretch but one thing to keep in mind; Nurks return has actually forced Melo to move back to more low post positions. Without Nurk, Melo was making those nice pass at the top of the 3 point line for cutter and open shooters.
How the hell did Kanter get 30 rebounds?? He had 6 more rebounds than points lmao
Kanter with a hint of defense would be OP
Kanter all NBA first team obviously
Enes the Menace out here bein a bully again
Kanter was unstoppable. Very nice to have a win where we lead start-to-finish.
I really like the more playmakerish role Dame has been playing since Norm joined

also, obligatory Enes because when he had 16 boards in that first half i thought 'maybe that's a 30 game'

it was a 30 game

that's dope
Who would've thought the highest number on the box score today would be rebounds
Kanter 😤😤😤
Saddiq and Sekou in double digits 😩
Love to see Enes set a team record - glad to have his name in the record book for posterity
I love you Enes especially having you in my fantasy team. Keep it up
E
I had to do a double take on Enes' stat line. 30 boards... Holy shit. Wish I hadn't missed this one.
30 rebounds?!? With 24 points? Shit saying that’s BIG BEEF doesn’t feel like it’s enough
Josh "Saddiq Bey" Jackson
24 and 30 from Kanter. Holy shit. Wow
That is future US-citizen Earl Kanter for you guys.
I love Enes so much. With just a little more defensive focus, my man could be an All-Star.
KANTER GODDAMN
Can we play the Pistons the rest of the season?
Norm was very generous to kanters big rebounding night
Wilt Kanterlain
Dame was the highest scorer in the game with 27. Kanter had more rebounds than anyone else had points... actually insane
Pretty sure they scored 100+. Ill get my calculator first to double check.

EDIT: Yep I think this one is greater. It has more numbers
How have both of them been this season?
I was expecting Ennis Canter
Saddiq has been amazing. Good defense, great shooting. about as much as I could want from a rookie wing. Sekou has been bad. pretty much all of the promise he showed last year went out the window. I personally think he is unconfident due to the extremely tight leash that Casey has on him. but hey, his only double digit scoring games have been in the last 10 games so hes improving maybe. He also has had better defense recently

edit: 10 games
Thank you for taking the time
np!
Holy shit, we won a home game.
LeVert
Pacers closing out in the 4th quarter (sort of)? I'll take it!
Really glad to see Caris have a great game!
I'm trying to figure out if detroit is just kinda bad, or if we've been sleeping on Edmond Sumner all year. Based on other games, I'm starting to think it's crazy he's not getting more playing time
Eddy go zoom
Cool game, competitive tank is always fun!
Levert with 28/6/4 and a dagger. Happy for him
And the dude should only improve from here
Levert
Team high +14 for Caris in 32 minutes in a 5 point win. Epic.
Fucking excuse me Caris LeVert
meanwhile Oladipo..

F = F = Fertitta
dayum Goga outscored Myles the birthday boy

good thing Myles isn't going to yell at Bjorkgren like Domas
So why do the Pistons start Plumlee over Stewart?
[deleted]
First home win since February 2nd. 

*Holy fuck.*
LeVert
We’ve been sleeping on Sumner no question
I mean we are also kind of bad, but like a good bad if you catch my drift.
He was real good.
You like to see hobos naked?
Uhhh yeah about that
LeVert
idk who this we is but it sure wasnt me
We are enjoying the Sumner experience
I do, and Bey looked really nice out there tonight
Not me either but there was a point where he was barely in the rotation
Yeah he's a really solid rookie, it'll be exciting to see how he progresses.
Kings: so actually we are tanking, please let us take this L

Pistons: no u
Greatest tank battle since the Battle of Kursk
WE'RE BACK BABY, ONLY GAVE UP 107 TONIGHT ELITE DEFENSE
Pistons just took away our losing streak. Can't have shit in Detroit. 

I'm also glad DSJ had a good game.
u can never out tank the pistons
These two were FIGHTING for their meaningless tank season win. That 4th quarter had some really protracted last minute drama
Better luck next time kings, pistons own the tank
Absolutely devastating game for Kings fans
The last 2 minutes of this game was the biggest tank-off I've seen in a long time
I’m not gonna lie that game had taking written all over it.
Tough loss. I'm cool with it.
Kangz undefeated when they are on a 9 game losing streak.
That was a wild last minute but it shouldn't have taken that long lol, Harrison Barnes' stepback was filthy, if hields outback counted that would have been sick
I guess someone had to win this game
Well that was arguably a basketball game
NO ONE BEATS US 10 TIMES IN A ROW
It took 15 minutes for the final 12 seconds to get played. Fucking hell
So we gonna talk about how bad that overturned dunk call was?? Kings almost got hosed.
noting to see her... just litle tankin
What the hell was that?
Dsj 17 points nice!
The perfect medicine for a losing streak, playing the Pistons.
Adam Silver looking for a way to retroactively nix the Dennis Smith Jr trade since it was so unfair to the league's biggest market.
I don't personally care that games end with a bunch of fouls, because that game definitely could have gone the other way and you should play to win (not to get the game over with as fast as possible).

That being said, that ending was ugly as hell.  Like I don't even get the strategy of when they chose to foul, when they chose to miss, etc.
I guess this is a major issue with our team.

We had *10* bench points. And most of those were at the end of the 4th.
Jokes on you, if you win against the Pistons then you're not a contender.
Go off Kings
How is Casey, Pistons fans?
Can’t even tank right 😭
Kangz snapping losing streaks since 2004.

Horrible win for the Kings. Might help Luke keep his job.
Kings are the equivalent of the Jets. Horrible team but even worse at tanking their record
Tank for Kuminga
WE BUILT DIFFERENT
He looks way better in Detroit. Getting out of the pressure of NY seems to have great for him.
except for the wolves
Not at the foul line though.  Even the ones that weren't blatantly missed on purpose had questionable effort.
Fade for Cade
No one hands us our TENTH loss in a row!

Ive never been so conflicted about a terrible call in my life
I thought at best it'd be no basket side-out.  That was a rough call.
He pushed off of Josh Jackson
Our fanbase is pretty mixed about him but personally I really like him as a coach for our rebuild
Or as Urinating Tree likes to call it:

TANK BOWL
[mfw](https://i.imgur.com/GXYgxtah.jpg)
Luke keeping his job for the rest of the season is actually great for the tank, if we fired him tonight this team probably would of got inspired and won more unnecessary games.

Gotta wait till after the season is over and make sure he gets the job done first.
No pressure in NY he was just bad and fell out of rotation. I'm glad he's off to a good start in Detroit
I don’t care if it’s petty, Minnesota does not deserve another #1 pick
And Josh Jackson was also clamped onto his shooting arm
He clearly didnt
I think the fan base is starting to like him, he's clearly a good development coach.
I can hear the music in my head when I look at the picture
The reason people say you sometimes need a fresh start is because the previous failure and negative feelings can be pressure onto themselves.
I don't mean the fans or team put pressure on him, he could have easily done it to himself just by having the perception that he had to perform well immediately being in a big city like that, especially when traded for a guy on the level of Zingus.
facts! although if the pistons are allowed a single number 1 pick, i would rather have emoni what ever year hes drafted. hometown hero
After Hield initiated contact. He literally got to the ball by pushing off
He had pushed off his right shoulder
I think the consensus is now that Rose is gone and Blake isn’t playing he’s well liked. Just need to bench Ellington now.
He got injured, traded to the Knicks, tried to play after he recovered and couldn't play well. He was also going through the loss of his grandma (?) while being boo'd by fans for his poor performance. That was fucking rough to watch. Was stuck in a really shit situation.
Emoni is 2023. We probably won’t have good odds to get him.
Agreed
More like Pistons need to trade Ellington now xD
Yup he's fine when you give him no choice but to play young guys
Step mother, but other than that you’re spot on
Devin Vassell is a straight up pro dude should be in the first sub group but just chills and stays ready to shoot 3s and play amazing team defense as a rookie.
Yay we won
You get a W! You get a W! You all get Ws!
I’m just here to simp for Dejounte Murray.
I’m just here to simp for Dejounte Murray
What tf happened in the 4th? 😂😂😂
I'm just here to simp on D3vin.
Much needed win to keep apace in the standings.
We had like 5 plays that could’ve been highlights posted here.

Poetl and Eubanks has blocks, Gay had the takeaway that rocked grant, Vassel had that sick dunk (for a rookie), and of course lonnies sick hook pass under the basket that was posted here.

It’s a shame so few people were able to watch. I love the young guys in this team, I really think we are on our way to being a perennial playoff team again.

And of course, I simp for Dejounte Murray
Sure, throw 18 minutes at Frank Jackson.  Why not.  I forgot he was still on the team.
The refs on both sides were absolutely horrible this game’s
The only one i saw was lonnies pass
lol this game existed
Dave with the +12 in 3 mins lol.
Let’s get it bois!!!
It should be illegal to field the lineup that the Pistons are trotting out there. That’s just shameful. Grant is the only one that I would consider even a borderline starter.
Another draft steal for the spurs :D
multiple time allstar
Pro is the right word. He plays like a vet and does what he's asked to do. If we didn't have as many wings and guards he'd see more minutes for sure, but you can see that Pop trusts him more than 95% of the rookies we draft.
Same but Drew Eubanks
Banned from twitch.
*banned from Twitch*
Devin got no respect lol. He had a clear jump ball that they called a foul and what looked like a clean strip they called a foul. Also Derrick got a foul called against him for backing up while straight up that they upheld even after review. I mean if that's a foul you literally can't play defense when a player drives. So dumb.
Our third team just kinda let the pistons score a bunch right at the end.

It was still never close.
the refs happened lmao

Pistons got a call for like 6-7 straight possessions
> We had like 5 plays that could’ve been highlights posted here.

Was Dejounte's buzzer beater 3 posted?
Did it?
Jakob double double
Was wondering why Luka only got 3 mins with a 20pt lead after the 3rd.
Yeah but Drew Eubanks +1
Didn’t mean one over the other, just hyping all the guys. Didn’t catch the whole game, but glad they did well
If you win every game +1, that’s an 82-0 record which is better than the 73 win Warriors. That’s why Drew Eubanks is the GOAT
HATE playing the Pistons. Harden came through in the clutch!
James Harden is the man
Harden and Kyrie combine for 0/12 from three and we still win.
How many points in a row did Harden score to close the game out?
Harden absolutely takes over the game after having a pretty middling 3.5 quarters.

You love to see it.
What are they now, 12-1 without KD? Would you look at that...
James Harden
Delon completely iced out jerami at the end there
Harden and Kyrie kind of played like shit this game for their standards, lucky to pull off the win.
this game never happened. fuck me why do under .500 teams give us so much trouble
Hey Detroit, that was not fun at all. Please fly back immediately and leave us alone
This year Hardens gonna get a ring, then people will start giving him his props for being a top 20 player of all time.

Ugly wins still count!  Happy Birthday Shamwow!  Loved seeing Harden delaying his postgame interview to keep working shit out with DJ lol, & Grady doing the play by play on YES!  Ugly win, but still had fun.

**BROOKLYN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
https://imgur.com/a/SZymfGK
That win was disgusting
Actually proud of the nets. They managed to win when the shots didn't fall and proved that they can play decent defense tho Jordan almost threw
James Harden passed Larry Bird on the all-time scoring list tonight with his last 2 free throws to ice the game
Pistons annoying as hell, like just go away. GG
poor mason
Shamet has been on fire since he got benched in late January
Today everyone bricked from 3 point line except joe and shamet. Wow. Tough day at office
Great game.

I say this fully believing the Nets are the favorites from the East, but Milwaukee and Philly are both set up to exploit their main weakness, which is of course DeAndre Jordan. He may have had a near double double tonight but we ate him up on the offensive glass. When it's Embiid or Giannis finishing that instead of Plumlee, it's gonna result in a bunch of and 1s. They better start accelerating the switch to Claxton.
DR JAMES EDWARD HARDEN
Landry Shamet is remembering how to play basketball and it's fucking beautiful. This teams gonna be insane once the whole crew is put together.
Did OP just delete a pic of Dr. Kuzlittle?
That's why James Harden is the mvp! If it were Leflop he would shoot 4 bricks in row, blame his teammates, and call it a night!
6-27 from three yikes but Shamet another good night
they finally fuckin did it, huh?
Why does Detroit play so good against the nets lmaoo
Why aren't the Pistons playing Sekou much?
Was this as close as it suggests?
This is awesome. Harden gets to half ass games for half the season and they still get wins. Hot dog
Ugly game, but they pulled through
Smh man I hate the Nets :(
The Pistons have one of the most pitiful rosters I have ever seen. Most of these guy’s shouldn’t even be seeing playing time. Plumlee, Ellington, and Wright are starting and they should be in the 10-15 range on the bench. Who the hell is Saben Lee? That franchise is a disgrace.
If the nets win the ring it’ll ring hollow and nets fans know this deep down. Knowing this makes me glad
just hangs with the hottest dudes
Always been the man, sadly gets a lot of hate!
Holy shit no wonder it was so close. Fortunately it looks like the Pistons bad 3 point shooting percentage also helped. They went 6/27(22%) and you guys went 8/32(25%) whoever the other players who made those 3’s on your team basically saved you.
I like it when they have a poor shooting night, Harden visibly stop shooting 3 even with enough space, and trying to attack in different ways.
Ah, the playoff special from harden.
10
10 I think
/u/anditsnotclosenephew hates to see it
KD is just sitting on the bench like the final boss. 

It’s kinda scary for the rest of the league.
I'm scared for the Lakers now
We’re also 9-1 in the last 10 games Durant has played and most of those were without kyrie
Was their only loss that Cavs game early on?
MVP
Floater game is straight untouchable. If it's falling he cannot be stopped
jimmy hardman
Yeah it’s gotta be really hard to put up numbers on this team against the Pistons lmfao

Edit: I replied to the wrong person, I thought I was replying to someone that said Harden for MVP. You can keep downvoting me tho idc lol and I think my point still stands, it’s hard for a player to get enough MVP votes on a team with 2 other all stars, and as far as I know nobody has ever won MVP with 2 other allstars, but feel free to correct me
Kyrie was decent today, just couldn't hit a 3 to save his life
Then you look at the score board, Harden 24/10/10 on 12/23 (if you count 2 free throw as one made field goal). And we think he played like shit. If someone else had that statline, they probably had a career night.
They have big men. That’s why I’m scared of the lakers and the jazz. The clips are a defensive team, so they’re kinda scary too. Nets best games came off a clippers loss though, so idk.
See you in 2 weeks. Rubber match!
Beautiful
Looks like an Italian from New Jersey that moved to Brookyln
I saw you posting the Kuz one, got me confused lol
Damn...looks like the manager of a KFC
Another one!
Nah, this was actually a good win. Won through defense despite a rough shooting night. Would've lost this one a few weeks ago.
The Pistons will put effort a lot of contenders thinking it’s just a free game. The win was quality because the Nets held on.
A lot of misses from both teams but it ended as a close game as usual from the Nets
You can’t play the Timberwolves every night. Some losing teams actually have heart and care about winning, but just aren’t there yet. 

Then, there’s the TWolves..
Love plums
DeAndre is washed, but rebounding is a pure team effort. Like last year we were the 2nd best rebounding team in the league because everyone gave a lot of effort in that field (plus we had Allen). But this year a lot of dudes will kinda half heartedly box out, and only do it when the game actually starts to matter. Like Stewart got so many o-rebounds this game where he was the 1 guy in between like 3 Nets just watching him. I blame DJ 100% when he barely tries on switches, but I'm not gonna blame him when he plays help defense and no one comes to box out his man and clean up the glass.

Also on a side note why KD is so key for our team (beyond being obviously really good at basketball). Harden is the engine of the offense but KD helps fill our two biggest holes, defense and rebounding. He's not a great rebounder for his size, but he's still a 7 footer who tries, and his defensive switch-ability is key for our schemes.
>  but Milwaukee and Philly are both set up to exploit their main weakness, which is of course DeAndre Jordan.

While this is true, neither of those teams have enough plus defenders that *also* meaningfully contribute to the offense to match up well to the Nets' big 3 either.  Simmons, Thybulle, and...Harris I guess?   I don't think that's enough for the big 3 as there will always be a mismatch and Thybulle is someone Brooklyn can leave open on the perimeter, not unlike what Houston did with Dort in the postseason last year.
I was exploring space in my spaceship When I saw LEASTRONAUT trying to steal the rings off Saturn 🪐 I had to report him to Barea and Space officer Curry LEMICKEY asked me for a ride home but I told him I'm not gonna carry you like ADisney and Kyrie did. Shame on you Lethief!
This take is brain dead.
That wasn't Detroit playing good, that was Detroit playing hard, which we generally do most nights. 
We just don't have shot makers down the stretch, so we lose close a lot.
He's been bad. He needs g league time still not nba ready, circumstances in the last year suck for him
The three minutes he was out there, his opponent scored every point for the Nets.
God some philly fans are fucking insufferable. We might not win a ring but im confident this nets team will run through the sixers in the playoffs. Aint winning shit with ben simmons as your second best player
Because of his ugly style of play in his Rockets tenure. Maybe the coach is to blame? Or he cant depend on anyone else on his orrvious team?
5 of them was Shamet
lmao pure filth. I love it
yeah ive noticed aswell him hating on every harden post :D dude has issues
LMAO I know harden ruined his day today and that makes me happy
Not surprisingly, the user is being pretty quiet tonight.
The mindfuck for me is if they play this nice in public, what do practices look like? Because they look like they’re in 85% lock-step. With KD they’re probably sickening.
Brooklyn Nets: This isn't even my final form
Harden paired up with either KD or kyrie is just damn good, can’t wait until KD is back and we get to see all 3 again
Nah it was against the Mavs. Cavs losses were a while back.
lmao if he did not win more than one on houston he ain't winning one on this team
Good thing he’s done the same shit against every other team in the league? Like what are you even implying here?
True but 10 of Harden's 24 came in the last 2 minutes. Up until that point he hadn't been scoring well and he had some really bad turnovers.
the nets have guys capable of rebounding as well. Size isnt the issue. It was the hustle. The pistons were crashing every miss and even thier guards were picking up offensive rebounds
Bro we have Plumlee and Isaiah Stewart
as usual?
Uhh I know that. I was making a joke about them always popping back up when we tried to put them away
DJ was looking much better at rebounding last year somehow, statistically want he one of the best in the league?
Stewart is also an incredible rebounder, he’s got the tenacity of Rodman/Wallace on the glass
That's probably true and why I think the Nets still come out on top. It's just too much fire power. But if there is a crack in the armor (say Kyrie gets hurt), it'll be inside.
Hahaha I haven't seen this one
Ok fair enough. I don’t watch Detroit so I don’t know how they actually play. It just seems like nets’s kryptonite is the pistons based off the results. It was just pretty funny bc nets have one of the best records and pistons have one of the worst but pistons always give the nets a super hard time more than other teams do.
Idk what makes it insufferable to say the truth. If you beat us in the playoffs it’ll ring hollow and will be expected. If we beat you you should be embarrassed you couldn’t even win by signing kd harden and kyrie, after not being able to build a team competently
Look at that team as soon as he left. I don’t knock John Wall (he hasn’t really shown me he can lead a team out of a slump), but they are, as he said, ass. Bootycheeks. Terrible. And people were expecting Harden to pull off a miracle every season. Bet you beard called KD on some I’m tired, get me out of here.
Has Shamet been playing good again? Love to hear him thriving.
What's up with some of these warriors fans having a particular hatred of harden? Like wtf lol?
Man was probably licking his chops ready to just destroy harden after he struggled scoring the ball and then bam Harden goes off for 10 clutch points to win the game.
He usually is quite when his shit takes are exposed
Lakers flair: opinion invalidated
Fuck you mean? This team is wildly better than any Houston team he’s had, even the one with cp3
Just that it’s hard to be MVP with KD and Kyrie also on your team lol, Harden is a cold blooded killer and all but it’s gunna be hard to win MVP with those guys on his team
Aye, you make a great point here. This is why I liked the Griffin pick, because he’s a pretty good rebounder.
And Jeremi Grant? I know he’s not a center but still
Yeah man have you not watched this team for the past few years. Scrapping out nail biters is practically our team culture at this point.
I wasn’t ragging on you. Hope it didn’t sound like that. I just take every opportunity to rag on the Wolves.
Yea I think he was up there last season if you adjust for per 36. DJ is still pretty solid at rebounding.  All he's got left is his rebounding and finishing around the rim. He's good for at least 2 of those BS o-rebound tap outs every game, which is awesome. Sometime DJ ball watches on the glass, but he's also a big part of the reason Harden's getting a triple double every other game. Harden's amazing but he didn't just turn into a 10+ rebounder over night, he gets a lot of boards because opponents are usually focused on DJ, thus Harden gets a ton of easy rebounds. As a team we're solidly in the middle, but when we play a sub par team our effort on the glass is way lower like tonight, which makes us look suspect.
We give every single team a tough time. We don’t have a lot of talent so we lose, but it’s a well-coached team full of “busts” and guys with something to prove so they always give 100% effort
you have the MVP shut the fuck up LOL
Are we pretending that Harden wasn't terrible in the playoffs previous years with decent teams? Even when he had good playoff games, he choked in the clutch.  
Not saying he isn't awesome, but there's a reason he got shit on despite the regular season numbers.
Yes he's been quite good lately after his horrific start. Was his birthday today and he went off.
He had himself a grand ole time last game vs the Celtics too, six threes iirc.
Harden helped shine a light on his game. Besides lebron, we need to talk about how Beard makes players look like they played in HS
Probably from those playoffs series but it’s pretty weird because they ended up winning them lol, tons of harden hating warriors fans out there tho
this is flairism and I won't stand for it
Should we pull up an Orlando Magic flair for the sake of parity?
Fuck I mean? Fuck you mean? Fuck we mean? 

You did not read my comment at all. I am talking about MVP; him being on a better team does not help those chances.
KD has played 5 games with james lol, he’s doing all this without him
Exactly? We didn’t just luck out and sign 3 stars completely changing the quality of our team over night, Embiid became mvp level in philly and the team has been built not bought
I just hate his foul baiting playstyle before which is being abused by Trae nowadays. Harden is great.
He has not been terrible for years in the playoffs, he was great against the lakers last year and was great against the warriors the 2 seasons before that, he also has played really good D in the playoffs in recent years, his team was just flat out outmatched and the one year they weren’t CP3 got hurt when they were on the verge of beating the warriors, that’s just bad luck.
While true he’s also just been hitting tough shots. He hit theees off screens tonight it wasn’t even off of harden penetration
Yeah that's what I'm saying lol, what's there to be so angry about. Harden doesn't even talk trash.
Shit bro that’s my bad lmao, but he still could win kne with this team if their record stays as crazy as it has been since he’s got there, and he consistently puts up like 24 11 and 7
My point is it’s hard to win MVP with that many all stars on one roster, as far as I know the only time it’s happened recently was with the 73-9 Warriors, and this Nets team isn’t going 73-9 lol
its lucky to have 3 stars wanting to come to nyc and compete? Do you know what luck even is? Sean marks is one of the best drafting gms in the league as well. Caris levert...Jarret allen and now Claxton? Signing dinwiddie and joe harris?
...he definitely wasn't great vs the Lakers, but I do agree that Westbrick and Daniel Sexhouse were the main culprits.  
What about when KD got hurt and the warriors still smashed them? Harden playoff numbers are perennially worse than regular seasons.  
And he has never...Never played great defensively, he's been average at best.   
He's in a perfect team now tho, he can do his thing for 40 minutes and then let other close for him.  
Again, not saying he's not an offensive powerhouse, but he is basically guard Karl Malone.
Ya it’s definitely weird, I’d understand if they lost to the rockets but they never did.
I definitely don't disagree Harden always puts up MVP numbers, but players on super teams never win MVP cause it's "easier"
That’s changing the goal posts. You acted like he was only doing this because he has good teammates against bad teams
it’s pretty lucky to have three stars want to come to nyc to compete because they’d be playing on a super team. The nets would not be contenders let alone favourites if it weren’t for the sudden buying of stars to make it a super team. It’ll still be great for the fans if they win it but not nearly on the level of a team that was built and won it in a more legit way
He averaged 30 points with a ts% of 66 against one of the best defences in the league whilst being doubled on literally every play. That definitely is great
Ya check again, he averaged 30 on amazing efficiency, he had one bad game where he still contributed in other ways and then he had 4 fantastic games. Anyone trying to say he wasn’t good in that series is delusional, he was literally  doubled all game by an elite defense and still put up fantastic numbers, his team was just way overmatched
Is the Nets team without KD a super team? Harden just quietly lead the team to 11-1 without KD. See how much the role players has turned around 1 by 1, and Harden is a key reason for that.
That’s not at all what I was saying? The guy above me said “harden for MVP” and I was saying it’s near impossible to win MVP with that many allstars on your team.
Any team with Harden is a super team, the voters just don't seem to respect him.
Doesn’t matter lmao you made a stupid comment now live with it
Ok find me an example of a team with 3 allstars and an MVP that didn’t have 73 wins lmao my argument is 100% valid, it has nothing to do with hardens skill, it has to do with voting. Gets hardens Dick out of your mouth and understand what I’m saying to you.
You replied to a comment and said it must be hard to put up stats against the Pistons with that team. It was a stupid ass comment and everyone knows it considering you got downvoted to hell. Please go somewhere now
Yeah BC how does a decent game against one of the worst teams in the east help his MVP case? 24 point triple double on horrible efficiency against one of the worst teams in the NBA? New MVP frontrunner!
He had 24/10/10 on 19 shots with great defense (3 blocks and 2 steals) and literally scored the teams last 10 points in a row to win the game himself. You need to give up, your argument gets worse every single reply
24 on 19 shots is not good lol, he really scored 16 points on 19 shots since he got 8fts. Also tied for the most TO with 4 and had a -4. This is nothing about him as a player, but this was far from his best game this year, and it was against one of the worst teams in the NBA and it’s supposed to help his MVP chances? GTFO. He had a below average game for him, against a well below average team. Idk how many more ways I can say this so you can understand lmao, he’s a top 5 NBA player no question but that doesn’t mean this game makes him more likely to win MVP at all
He had 24 on 19 shots. It’s not great but it’s not a horrible game considering he was elite at every other single aspect of the game. He had 10 assists to 4 turnovers, the fuck is wrong with that? Nobody cares about single game plus minus.

This *is* about him as a player, you can’t stand to see him doing good and people giving him credit lmao. He scored the last 10 points in a row to win a game in the clutch and youre really pressed that fans of his team are happy and think he should win MVP, he’s the best player easily on the soon to be first seed, better get fucking used to more MVP talks lol
Bro have you read any of the comments I made? Not a single one was about harden being a bad player, they’re all about him playing a bad team and his team being stacked. People from teams this stacked just generally don’t win MVP. Curry/KD never won one during their warriors run. Lebron was the last one with 3 all stars and that was because outside their big 3 that team was terrible, Mario Chalmers was their 4th best player, nowhere near as good as the record setting Season Josh Harris is having (nobody has ever shot that well on that many attempts). Stop playing the victim. I am a harden Fan, just being realistic about his chances. Also Lebron played pretty much every game those years, lretty sure harden had missed more games this year than Lebron missed both those Heat MVPs combined
Kevin Durant and James harden have played a total of **5** games together
So what? He’s still on the team, he’s going to be back, and he’s a top 10 player in the league. MVP voting is all about narrative, and this narrative doesn’t help his case.
But can Zach Lavine be the 12th option on a contender?
THE PAW HAS BEEN BORN TONIGHT STACEY
Patrick Williams is eerily similar to early Kawhi
If he's not an All-Star, we riot
This man is an allstar, no if, and, or buts
If you still think Zach Lavine is just a "good stats bad team guy" then I'm embarrassed for you because you are stupid and you should feel bad
I never want jeremi grant to play the bulls again in my life
On a more serious note: i don’t like the paw nickname. It’s gonna be really awkward when Pat becomes better than Kawhi
Lavine is the best player no one gives credit to
Lavine and Grant both balled the fuck out
Grant was a monster out there. There's nothing we could do. He almost singlehandedly won them that game in the 4th
Zach Lavine better be an all-star
Lavine is just a fun as hell dude to watch
ZACHARY FUCKING LAVINE. Btw fuck that ref who didn’t call the foul on Plumlee with the foul on WCJ.
Delon the ultimate tank commander looking for his own with Jerami playing like he was
biggest comeback by any team this year btw
zach "dragging us to victory" lavine
Nice come back boys
ZACH "EMPTY CALORIES" LAVINE JUST FORCED THIS TEAM TO THE WIN
Zach got like 2 or 3 half court dunk off the dribble tonight

cut through that defense like butter
That first half was so painful to watch, this team is so inconsistent, one half they play like the 1996 Bulls and another they play like, well, the 2021 Bulls
Karnisovas is on some pimp shit with this organization
Jerami Grant has reached his potential 

Man we are fun
Gg bulls

What a game to watch especially the last few minutes, I wish it could have went to ot so we could see Grant hit 50 potentially and have another great 5 minutes of bball but whatever, the competitive tank always wins
THE TANK ROLLS ON
Fucking huge win, but I never want to watch jerami grant play against the bulls again.
37/5/5/3 from Zach
Zach and Grant went crazy this game
paw and vine men good
The Paw <3
Patrick Williams is 19.
My anxiety peaked each time Grant had the ball. I was almost sure that 3 was going to go in at the end there. Lavine and Grant were amazing to watch tonight.
SWEET LIFE OF ZACK & COBY!!
Seddiq Bey over Lavine for player of the week. What a joke lol
Shoutout to the pistons fan that came to our game thread at half to tell us how badly he felt for Lavine.
Zach Lasagna can carry my kids🤗
Zach is averaging like 32/6/5 for Feb on elite shooting splits. Get this man to the all star game.
7
Fade for Cade
Word is some Pistons fans felt bad for LaVine 👀
Grant should be an all star tbh
I really do think LaVine/Pat/Coby is a great core. And that isn’t even accounting for Carter or Lauri
[deleted]
Not enough calories unfortunately.
Maybe a 15th option. 12th is a little high
Some Raptors flair this offseason said he “wouldn’t see the floor” because defense even if the Raptors theoretically added him for free with no cap implications. And of course it had about 30 upvotes.
GIMME THE HOT SAUCE, PAW!
On MJ's birthday, not a coincidence I tell you.
The Paw
doesn't even smile either
He prolly picked up on some stuff when he played Kawhi last week. Kawhi absolutely eviscerated him. Pat was always 1-2 steps behind and Leonard was perfect from midrange when Williams guarded him. Leonard cooked him. It was a welcome to the NBA moment.
Which one

They both made their cases tn

But ya Levine definitely deserves it this year
LaVine or Grant?
Flashback to Bill Simmons who called him the ultimate good stats bad team guy a few days ago
If I was the gm of a good team I would try hard to trade for him. He can def be the number 2/3 guy on a good playoff team
that description fits Jerami Grant well lol
Yeah, winning a one-possession game at home against an 8-19 team proves that.
(PA)trick (W)illiams. Makes sense but it ain't intimidating. Still a good nickname tho
Just think of it as a paw contains multiple claws
I still like project pat
we all know flower boy is his nickname
Pdub sounds good enough to me lol
Absolutely. And usually when anybody mentions something like that, fans start suggesting players like Caruso, which only further proves the point.
Because the bulls were so bad so no one ever watched. We had the worst coach I’ve ever seen in my life. I hope Jerami Grant doesn’t start to get the same criticism as an empty stats guy, cuz he’s a dog too.
And Lavine singlehandedly won that game for you guys, it was the Detroit Grants vs. the Chicago Lavines
Sure but they also called Plumlee for goaltending unfairly
Yeah that's a dangerous play, could really hurt his shoulder doing that
for real, what the hell was he thinking?
Now they're saying he has too many calories
*the 2020 Bulls
THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACH
It is a lot to do w team record and Saddiq balled tf out

No need to get so salty u guys just won the game lol
Coby has been pretty awful tbh
You’re a celtics fan i wouldn’t talk
people gonna get upset at this joke lol
Zach "Diet Water" LaVine
Your homerism’s showing. He could maaaaybe be the 15th option on a g-league team
This sounds made up
SIRACCHHA!
I like to think Paw was absorbing his skill in a voodoo way. But seriously I'm all in on this dude. Idk that he's the next Kawhi, but he just looks like a natural born hoopster.
Was talking about Lavine. Grant has been great too, and I love him, but a 15th seed isn't getting an allstar unless he's voted in, which he won't be
Yes
Yes
Yes
why not both
Tbh they've both been individually fantastic
Yes
I wish both. I’ll give the nod to Zach 1) because I’m a homer and 2) because I see Grant in a similar spot as lavine last season (breakout season, but not quite enough to put him ahead of other worthy choices)
Both tho
You know
The Bulls should try hard to trade for Grant to pair with Zach.
Lets not act like most of fans including Bulls thought the same thing. 

It just another example of how we are too impatient and not wait for players to actually develop before judging them. Zach came into the league looking like a twig playing against 30 year old men.
He can be the #1 guy on a playoff team, if someone builds around him like the jazz did with mitchell
Fortunately you are not the GM of a good team so in Chicago he remains
Honestly, He would be the number one scoring option on most contenders, he can score from anywhere anytime. Imagine him having other players who can score around him so that he doesn't get doubled every play. He would also have more assists and less turnovers playing off ball.
against a team thats been playing well (sorry to compliment your own team) while his teammates shot 4/22 (18%) for 3 for the game. 

when he started getting doubled at the end he made good quick passes that led to good shots

he did good
Leading the biggest comeback of the season while putting up 37/7/7 on 14/22 shooting? Hell yes it proves that.
How many possessions was it before he checked back into the game?
When I was in college the frisbee team called me Pattymelt and put it on my jersey. I will gladly donate it to my boy lmao
I mean, do we remember that Derrick Rose's nickname was Pooh?
I think flower boy is fine for now but when he hits his prime hes gotta get an upgrade to The Florist
I’ve got a buy 1 get 1 chipotle coupon that says in a couple years they’ll be facing off in the conference finals. ANY TAKERS?!?!
That was an atrocious call but such is the standard of refs today. I was shocked they called it in real time and the replay confirmed it
I definitely thought so at first but then they showed another angle and the ball was coming down even if it hadn't hit the glass yet
He was thinking “who are the best 5 hoopers of all time? Delon, Delon, Delon, Delon and Delon, because I shoot hot fire”
This
fuck you for not rooting for the team i like
It shouldn't be though, it's not team of the week....i'm not too bothered but it's clear how much the league and fans in general disrespect lavine. What more does the guy have to do? He rarely gets foul calls, doesn't get recognition, is called an empty stats guy. It gets frustrating over time.
It’s a joke man

U have to lose to the pistons to become real contenders
If you mean assistant water boy then absolutely
It does, but I definitely recall it, I can't find it right now.
Ik u were talking about Lavine I was just making a joke kinda about how good they both were tn

And ya ik grant probably won’t be an all star but he’s still been amazing and he has a chance to get in the next couple years if we become a playoff team
didn’t Trae Young make it in last year while the Hawks were last or second to last?? i can’t remember if he was voted in or not
#yes?
The Pistons should try hard to trade for Zach to pair with Grant.
Don’t think the pistons will be trading him any time soon
I can confidently say i've never thought that. I also thought his contract was great the moment we signed him
Recently? Bc BS said this like less than a week ago
You had guys on your sub talking about trading Lavine last week and tanking.
I would do unspeakable things to get bam with him
I agree, but if he’s winning a ship it’s as a number 2 imo. Murray type role
Yeah don’t listen to that guy, you should be stoked, Lavine is legit
> (sorry to compliment your own team)

It's okay just please don't let it happen again
I think this year more people are starting to realize how good he truly is

And to ur point about potw, ya maybe ur right it *shouldnt* be based on team records but they have always done it like that so u can’t really expect it to change now, Booker missed it one time while averaging 50
Don’t worry grants getting that MIP for sure, unless I’m missing someone else, idk who is more deserving than him though.
> he has a chance to get in the next couple years if we become a playoff team

I really hope he does. Been a fan of him since his OKC days.
Random question: is Grant expected to be traded? What are the reports from your people? Do Pistons want him traded for assets or keep him because he's a stud?
He was indeed voted in.
Yea but the Bulls actually have the assets to possibly get a deal done without trading Lavine. I know it won't happen though, Grants a stud.
Oh yea both Bill and Lowe are dense about Lavine. 

It's because everyone judged him too early and not they don't want to be wrong.
Yo, chillll
Simmons would be a great fit as well
Zach would look great in Trix Yogurt colors
Grant with Zach on the Bulls would look nice. I think it would be easier to get an up and coming star.
Yeah Saddiq is a nice player. I don't dislike him but i feel he should've gotten the rookie of the week or something. I think my main grievance is Lavine missing so many calls....against the Pacers he had 2 freethrows (4 intentional foul) and dropped 30....tonight he had 5 and scored almost 40....how many guys in the league are scoring these types of numbers while barely shooting freethrows?
Thanks man, and ya I believe ur not missing anyone else. It’s grants to lose at this point

Wood is the only other guy but he was injured for an extended period of time so it seems unlikely w him
Yeah it was wood until he got injured now it's Grant's to lose
Right now at least we have 0 plans to move him as far as I’m concerned, that’s from fo (front office) and fans perspective

Next year or mainly the year after I’m sure we can start thinking about moving him because he will be on an expiring contract but idk since that’s so far away

What I can tell u is that a lot of fans are hoping that his 3 years on his current contract are transition years for us to become good and if that happens we would plan on resigning him and hopefully become a good team w him tho

If we are bad in 2 years tho I’m sure there’s a good chance he will be moved
Grant is legit untouchable lol, our GM’s known him since he was a kid & is building around him, keep dreaming tho
No other way around u gives bam for Felicio and Otto Porter
wtf did we have to pick the wrong grant. It was a 50/50 chance
Ya ur right those ft numbers and points output don’t seem like they should match but Levine is a stud

I’ve only watched a few bulls games this year so I haven’t really been able to notice him getting shafted on calls but I will believe u based on the stats, it definitely seems like he should get more
Should have had both of them on the same team :/ idk why the pistons didn’t keep Wood. You would have two budding stars.
I just think their playstyles complement each other. Bulls, Knicks and Pistons are all got some breakout star players this year
He drives a lot but anyways, the pistons are the best worst team i've seen in recent memory. Hopefully you guys go somewhere in the next few seasons
I think it has a lot to do w wood not wanting to play on a bad team and weaver wanted to do his own thing

It’s always sad to see a player leave and ball out but w wood I don’t mind cuz I kinda think of it as a Grant for wood type of thing and I’m definitely happy w Grant
Grant’s play style complements everyone lol hes one of the best forwards in the league
Thanks man, u guys are amazing to watch too (at least tn) and willams looks amazing, some huge shots in the 4th 

I’ll be rooting for bulls and their fans, always seemed like u guys have some reasonable and good fans (baring some mj extremists)
Yea that's why I said I would like him next to Lavine lol

I wouldn't say he is untouchable but I can see the Pistons saying that. Especially since he chose Detroit
And I want Lebron & Embiid on my team!
Cool. Those are MVP caliber players on contenders it would be hard to get them. 

Grants a break out player entering his prime on one of the worst teams. It's more plausible of a trade, just like Beal.
It ain’t plausible. That’s my point. You can keep dreaming but it’s never going to happen.
I'm not dreaming I just said Grant looks good. Lol

Grants looks nice but to call him untouchable is illogical, if anything I would sell on him high after this season. 

As not a pistons fan, he looks good. But isn't going to make an all star game and didn't look like this on a contender. He still has a lot more to prove.
You’d sell a guy that rejected a playoff team to specifically play for you while you’re rebuilding? The most sought after free agent chooses Detroit, and you think we’ll sell him after a season? He also rejected the likes of the raptors, the celtics, bucks, etc. to come here. What message does that send to future free agents, we’ll literally never attract anyone ever again.

Grant is the cornerstone of this team, he’s what the GM is building around. It’s like if someone said you guys should sell lavine now while his value is high. It’s ridiculous.
No, I wouldn't sell on Grant, but I would think about it. If I'm the Pistons I'm trying to build around him for sure especially rn that you're not a destination. He can be that cornerstone just like Lavine is to us. 

I was just saying him and Lavine would look good together lol
Agreed, they’d look good together in detroit :)
As long as we get the real dunk contest winner Griffin, Zach is yours
The Knicks records going into the All-Star break since 2013-14: 20-32, 10-43, 23-32, 23-34, 23-36, 11-14, 17-38, **19-18**

The year might be 2021, but this Knicks team is the best they’ve been since 2012. I hope they can keep it up in the 2nd half because the Knicks being good is a good thing for the league. Also, the fans deserve it.

We’re 19–18, how do you guys not know the record of our own team
Frank Ntilikina
knicks win

me happy
almost a very ugly ending for us, we were pretty much checked out of the game up by 15+ with 3 min left but the Pistons kept applying fullcourt pressure and if they had 1-2 more min they might have came back
Did Frank fuck Thibs’ girl or something? Elf was having a good game but Bullock playing 32 min to Frank’s 13 makes no sense especially because Bullock played like shit and Frank was nice in his short action
Julius Randle™
WE ARE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS AND NO ONE CAN CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE!!
Eight players in double figures!  Surely we...no?  Ok then.

Woah, the Knicks are now the 4 seed in the east. Crazy stuff, how many people predicted this would happen.
[deleted]
> 17-38

God the Fizdale years were brutal
we have a lot of very tough games in the West, it's gonna be extremely difficult for us tbh especially since we're the worst scoring team in the NBA. Hopefully though we can maybe make one more trade to bring in another wing scorer, Bullock hasn't been consistent enough for us at the 3 to be considered a reliable option and our 4th Quarter scoring options has been terrible outside of Randle and RJ. I don't even know if there's a reference for it but I'm pretty sure we have the worst 4th quarter scoring in the NBA

edit: according to [this](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/4th-quarter-points-per-game), we're 27th in 4th quarter scoring. After we acquired Rose that issue was mostly gone but with him missing the game today, not having D Rose almost hurt us and cost us a win
Damn even Mavs fans like our team we really as likeable squad this year
I'm drawing a blank...what year is 11-14? 25 games?

Next four out of six games after the break are gonna be tough
Pretty tough, and a hellish 6 game road stretch at the very very end.
one of the easiest in the league. but these lads fear no one. so we're gonna solidify that spot. don't worry. Good luck to Blazers as well.
Tough
The post game box score generator is broken is my guess because these threads have been wrong for months now and nobody gives a fuck. Drives me nuts.
One of our calling cards this season in excelling once the other teams gets so far ahead that they lose interest.
Don’t feel bad it’s the Pistons specialty they do it every time they’re getting blown out
for real we’re allergic to that 15ish point lead. Every time we go up like 15-20 in the second half I get excited to see some bench guys get minutes but it never happens cuz we fall asleep for a couple minutes and let them close the gap
Was dealing w an injury coming in. Surprised Thibs played him as little as he did even so.

That's really not all that different from the rest, except 11-14.
Everything you said is right, but nonetheless, I'm rooting for you guys in every game down the stretch except when you play us, since you kinda schooled us last year and I'm still kinda salty about that lol
What do you think about Knox and a future 2nd for Delon Wright? Not a scorer, but a decent 3 point shooter and a solid defender.
Did they mean 11-41 maybe?

And this is when the rubber meets the road
I think the entires rest of the season is brutal from when I looked at it..
Thx bro
it's not even that, we've had bad losses in the past because of a lack of awareness or desire in the 4th Quarter where we'd be scoreless for half of the quarter, Thibs in particular when the broadcast showed him today was extremely pissed off with everyone on our team for not keeping the intensity up and if they had tied it up he may have smashed his clipboard.
Yeah I obviously don’t know the injury severities but Elf played 35 min in a very similar injury situation. I love Thibs but his rotations confuse me sometimes. Although I’m liking keeping IQ out of the starting lineup for now
We're like thriving fungus on top of hardened 8 year old garbage juice.
i’m like hey wassup hellooo
it was part of the trade agreement, yall knew the deal
It is Frank though, I'd rather us be cautious with him considering how much time he's missed already this year.

WE want the reddit boxscores back.
Wiggins with an efficient 27. How much help does Steph need?
Game was over when Oubre made his 3
Wiggins and Wiseman holding down the fort in the 4th allowing Curry to rest. Pls give us more of that thanks.

Pretty nuts Wiseman had more games in this road trip than he did in college.
Wiseman's potential is fucking scary! Dude is 7'1 250lbs and can run the floor!
Look at Wiggins man
Wiseman with the +/- of +23 lmao
IDK what got into Wiggins but he went the fuck off in the 4th.
Josh Jackson is playing really well. Guys are playing hard and that’s all you can ask for.
god i love LEE GOD
It appears skyfucker has made an appearance
It appears that r/nba was a tad ahead of itself on Steph’s “demise” after the first two games
It is time to be seriously concerned  about Steph Curry
Our defense was stifling at points, holy shit 

One of the big concerns in the first two games was the decision making, but you can see these guys actually look to pass and see the open man - improvement on that end makes it much better to watch

And no Wiggins slander tonight, dude was making plays

Rebounding and free throws were an issue.

&nbsp;

Detroit also struggled on offense, especially when Blake went down. I like their young guys though, they have a solid core - Grant was nice today also

These refs were pretty shit, so many whistles. Kinda typical at the beginning but whatever
Wiggins slander is now illegal for ~~48~~ 72 hours.
WIGGGGGIIIINNNNNSSSS
I’M SO HYPED FOR WISEMAN

Also, no Steph or Wiggins slander tonight please and thank you
I'm sure everyone's going to talk about Wiseman's block into a coast-to-coast dunk, which was nice, but I was actually more impressed by the contest a minute or so later, when the attacker made a very difficult layup after Wiseman stayed close all the way to the rim, hand right there.  

Even though the guy made the shot, it was a *great* contest. So many young players will foul, there. But the body control and awareness on defense were just - I'm absolutely sold on this guy turning into an absolute stud a couple of years down the line. 

(Of course, he gave up a really poor foul a couple of minutes later, but that's fine. He's 19).
Kelly Oubre made a 3. League fucked
Wiggins please just do this every night thanks
Of everyone on Golden State, open shot... fate of the universe on the line (or martians have a death beam pointed at earth), who better hit it? I WANT DAMION LEE.
Andrew Wiggins 4th quarter carry!
Steph is getting into his rhythm
It's like his 7th game since high school, Wiseman was the right call for us.
juan.
Is it just me or was Wiseman mad he balled out?
0-82 here we go. carry over to next season!
I don’t wanna overreact but we’re back. Wiggins is an all-star, James Wiseman roty, Steph in mvp form. And Oubre still hasn’t found his groove and we haven’t even unleashed Draymond. Literally the Western conference champions at worst.
Wiggins really went out there to prove a point to all of the Warriors fans who were shit talking him like myself
I'm liking this Andrew Wiseman guy.
I heard Steph was washed though
Wiseman getting those early fouls hurt but it was clear Kerr was using it to teach him not to jump on defense. Need to get better at rebounding which will be harder with a thinner center depth but shots seem to be falling and ball movement is much better
Around 5minutes in both the 3rd and 4th quarter there were glimpses of the old warriors
Wiggins has had 3 consecutive good games, with each better than the last
Lotta people deleting their curry slander rn lol
Pistons, you're the Thunder now.
Wiggins: fuck r/nba
so sad we won't have all that posts and comments about how Curry can't carry a team. won't somebody please think of the children?!! what hot takes they gonna embrace today?!
Look at Wiggins man so inspirational
Pistons really built their team around Jerami Grant. He might make the all-star team just on volume.
'bron fans told me steph is washed 🤔
Lol more people keep talking down on Curry’s name, the more he performs.
Look at curry man
Wiseman is just so damn good.
Kelly Oubre finally decided to wake up and be a NBA player.
Wiseman and Wiggins were solid this game, and Curry looking like more of his old self tonight. People really doubted this man
2 back to back 30+ games for Curry as he's shaking off rust. I guess get the Steph slander out while you can...
Where are the Harden and Lebron stans now talking shit about Curry? MFers acted like a 2 time MVP and GOAT shooter of all time was done after 2 bad games lol. 

Curry is about to go skyfucker mode, book it.
WE’RE GOING STREAKING
LET STEPH COOK
We Believe 2.0
Wiseman looked game changing at certain points. He came back in when we were down 12 and it felt like we had a whole new squad. Dude’s length alone was forcing Detroit into so many bad shots.
Gentlemen, we have now entered the Wiggins spiral
What’s the record for consecutive made free throws ? 72 seems like a lot
Giannis reminds me of a young Wiseman with less shooting touch
Warriors fans, don’t get too excited. The Pistons are tanking on purpose!
Did a warriors fan get drunk and give everyone gold last night or is klay in this thread?
Steph carried by Andrew Wiggins smh
Someone help Jerami Grant. I fucking love that dude
All I took away from this was Killian Hayes is gonna be special
Did Blake get hurt again? Why did he only play 17 minutes?
I just clocked out of work 

how did the dubs do
LETS GO LLWWARRIORS
There's obviously going to be growing pains, but great players like Steph find a way to get through it.
How long will it be until Jerami Grant regrets leaving the Nugs?
Wiggins balling out, tears in my eyes man
Welp, let's see when we'll get that first W...
Warriors have played and looked better every game, can't ask for more
I guess washed Curry was a bit of an overexaggeration
Damion Lee > Robert Horry !!! Heard it here first !!
D Lee with a CLUTCH three in back to back games.
Never in doubt - warriors are a very decent team with curry and wiseman healthy , they’ll make the playoffs this year for sure
After a bad start a nice recover job by GS
Where are all the “Curry is washed, GS is done” guys at?
most of these players haven't played in months, it was expected that the first 2-3 weeks were going to be bad. this was a fun game to watch.

wiseman looks like he has unlimited potential and wants to learn. excited to see what he's able to do this season.
Steph 3rd mvp back on the menu
Hot take: Steph Curry is pretty good at basketball
Surpasses derozan as the 100th leading scoring in nba history
Are the Pistons worse than the bulls?
Pistons fans, what you guys think of Killian so far? From the games I've watched, he just doesn't seem ready for significant minutes. Coming in as a prospect, I thought for sure he'd be one of the more consistent offensive rookies.
At least we are not on the same level as the bulls and pistons!

For real though we got a lot to work with and the raw pieces are going to come together eventually.

I love seeing Draymond coach Wiseman on the sidelines
Bbbbb b b but they cut off the blow out heat game for this ;(
Let’s get a top 3 pick Detroit!
how bad was Hayes's injury?
So where are the hot takes that it was over for Steph?
where the fuck the box scores? am i missing something? weren’t they in reddit?
This piston team shouldn’t be that bad! Come on man
It's Blake hurt? Why did he only play 17 min.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Ua7yJhdcA
You just got beat by the warriors in 2020
Damn, maybe the Pistons should have kept Gelo.
Anyone on the Wiggins train doesn't understand that he's only good in the early season, against bad teams, when you've been eliminated from the playoffs, and other times when being good is not of value. You'll see.
Took a game versus the Pistons for Steph to play like a franchise player. 

Better late than never
Feels like pure shit just want her back.

Me too man, me too
Or at least let's all agree to post the box scores from basketball reference
The mods said they are working to fix it I think
one lakers match had it.
Me too.
mhmmmm
Bless up
What happened to them?
Seriously bro imagine if any other all star got to play with Wiggins. They’ve be playoff teams too
[deleted]
Wiseman had some nice plays and bothered shots at the rim, Wiggins scoring was very valuable, but the dubs don’t win this game without wannamaker
Holding the fort*
And can shoot!
Andrew Wiggins saw us talking shit lmao
So inspirational.
> Look at ~~Wiggins~~ Maple Jordan man
So happy I bought low on Wiggins in my Fantasy league.
It was either on Simmons’ or Lowe’s pod recently that one of them said for all the shit Wiggins gets, he’ll finish his career with 20,000+ points at this rate.
Ehh, he does this all the time. Flashes of efficient games after loads of terrible ones.

And the Pistons look like the tank to beat this year..

Good luck to Wiggins hustling this year.
We drafted Giannis
He played well, but a lot of that was just him being in when Wiggins decided to score a billion points
Says more about Looney's -10. He just has no presence on either end.
It's the worst part about having Wiggins on your team... He will have games where he takes complete control, and it makes you think maybe he's rounding a corner. Sometimes he'll even have multiple consecutive game streaks where he looks like an all star, and then he inevitably comes back down to earth and looks like the Wiggs we've seen so far. 

I think most twolves fans are rooting for Wiggins, but every single one of us have seen this legitimately ~50 times from him. Hoping he can put it together with the talent and coaching the warriors have, but this game tells us nothing.
Just let him play vs OKC every day

Is that meme still actual?
Damn 0-4? What’s up with the Pistons?
Everyone in that Bulls game thread saying he washed L M A O
This sub + knee jerk, name a more iconic duo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6oKfADOKa0
It really was the cornrows lmao
the Bron fans started talking reckless about Steph’s legacy after 2 games lmfaoo
The disrespect Steph has always gotten is kinda shocking tbh. No other superstar would get doubted based off 2 bad games (against 2 serious championship contenders) the way Steph did
Someone told Steph that the first 2.5 games were for charity. He has been on fire ever since the second half of game 3.
Steph: The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated
Curry is great, but not only does he have to adjust to a KD-less team, he also has to redefine his role with this misfit roster. He has to do more leading and scoring, but I think he could do a decent job and take the Warriors pretty far for where many expect them to go (unless they decide to tank again).
As per usual, I am so inspired right now
Got carried by Andrew GOAT Wiggins and pretty Kelly Oubre
He looked really good. Still looked like prime steph to me but man the warriors team is not very good right now. Steph would get open off ball but they would miss him a lot. I think dray will make a big difference
And Wiggins.
They were on pace to go 0-72 to be fair
Warriors vs Pistons might be a finals matchup.
On the other hand, is two games enough to say he’s back?
We back to .500 boys! (After playing the Bulls and Pistons, but shhhhh)
You think those people meant that Steph would never have a single good game ever again? 

Dude played well against the pistons. Big deal. He’s a 2 time MVP and playing well against the pistons is the bar you’re setting for him? Lol
I heard he is washed now. r/nba analysts called it.
He washed
Lmao i like this, straight to the meme
Yall playing full court press vs Bulls impressed me a lot.

Plus, Oubre having insanely quick hands for the pokes is nice too
> Our defense was stifling at points, holy shit

I mean, it's Detroit. 

But still nice to see.
Well, luckily for us we have Draymond still to come back. Who is our best defender and second best playmaker.
Can really see the improvement. A lot more to work on, but they finally try passing more but not pounding the ball for 10 seconds
I must say that I watched the Warriors stream today with your announcers and they are so annoying and terrible
Against a team whose 3 best offensive player sare Rose, Grant and fucking Jackson...
I got my slander pre-typed for 12/31/2020 at 9:50PM EST
\*72
I did a baddie earlier. I repent

[Edit: I still think it was funny though](https://reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kmp1hm/_/ghgimwc/?context=1)
ANDREW WINNINGS
on juan
He had just been told to watch it, had 5 fouls, then he immediately gets his 6th on a dumb play.
I missed the game due to work, what do you mean by that?
No I have him on fantasy and all his other games were better.
There's 72 games in the season. You tryna make the #1 pick unreachable
Not to get ahead of ourselves but I think Andrew Wiggins might be better than prime michael jordan.
Combined with “Michael” Jordan “get in the” Poole, you’re unstoppable
And now that he's accomplished his goal he will go back to normal lol until we complain again
He is washed. He rode stacked teams into rings and faked a hand injury last year because he can't carry. /s.
The Broly syndrome.
Wiggins is MIP ez

Edit: My award is as cold was Wiggins was for the first 3 games
Literally nobody’s Curry slander is invalidated by a good game against Detroit.
Beatin the pistons equals carrying a team? Lol wow. 

The bar for Curry is so much lower than any other MVP
This guy decided he wanted to be the 1st or 2nd option on a shit tier team over a 3rd or 4th option on a contender lmao
Sweet music to my ears -*Baby faced assassin*
Ninety seven.

Just 27 more to go.
Holy shit i believe youre right
klay got drunk
Don’t worry, Cade Cunningham will
Concussion
Wiseman elbow to the jaw.
Curry and Wiggins did great, Lee hit a important 3 and Wiseman didnt play amazing but had some highlight plays and a good +/-
I doubt it tbh. Got the bag and a bigger role from the looks of it. Win/win?
Step Curry
ankle or lower leg injury that kept him out. Think it was precautionary though
Generator is kill
We are
Took an inadvertent elbow from Wiseman in the first half. Had to sit with concussion symptoms.
He's in a shooting slump since he hasn't regularly played nba since 2019 finals. Give him time to cook.
This take is so awful I don't even know where to begin
Yeah, it took him maybe 2 games to wipe off over a year of rust. Don't worry man, he might have a cold shooting game in a few days.
I just want it to get easier...
this but unironically
Aye!
So, it works?
OOTL, why aren't they working?
Those aren't updated until the next day or so
That’s what I’m saying !!
KAT was an All Star ...
Well yeah. But there were 3 more quarters after too
More like "winner maker" am I right?
Yeah I gotta give it up to big head and JTA.  i was flat out on both before the year, but nice contributions the last two games.  Depending on the matchups those guys are gonna be outclassed, but you make the playoffs on the back of these types of games, not the nets and bucks games.
This is a roster thin on talent right now, they don't win without contributions from everyone.
If the Lakers fan base can bully him like they did KCP, I'll take it
Ok fine he saw **me** talking shit.
Keep up the good work, keep talking shit.
People have basically been talking shit about Wiggins for the past three seasons so...
This but unironically
Same. I was expecting bad news after the 1st couple of games but this one gave me hope.
A bigger and taller 3pt shooting Giannis 😳😳😳
Already a smoother stroke
If u squint kinda looks like KD
There’s something to that. Wiggins and him gel w the bench mob and Steph out
Honestly, I don't have much faith. I'm just hoping for better than the first two games. I'm hoping more of his shots go in, because a ton are on open looks. But overall, keeping my expectations low.
Yeah, for sure. Honestly just hoping he can at least play decently against bad teams because those are the games we absolutely must win. I don't expect him to change overall as a player though.
Seems like most twolves fans on reddit will go out of their way to talk crap about him.
I think the hope is that Wiggins can help them win a few games, and then Steph can help win and close out a majority of the other ones. Basically, the standard Wiggins will be good enough for me. Lol
can u imagine if Wiggins was drafted to Philly? He’d be the GOAT
I'm a bit OOTL but why does he vary so much. Is it just a focus thing with him?
I can already see others getting sucked in and hoping... The disappointment is real
Did he similarly flash defensively in your experience? Or were these "rounding the corner" games more limite dto the offensive side of the ball?
Griffin didn't play last night and didn't play the second half of this one. Perhaps they still lose both but it is part of their issues for sure.
We were leading the TWolves the whole game except for the last 4 minutes. Then double OT. Then lost a relatively close game by 8 to the Hawks.  We were in this game basically the whole time too. We just don’t have closers. Blake is good but his passing and first step have regressed. Grant is a fine 3rd options but he is our number 1. Rose is playing like doo doo.  Right now our most consistent bucket besides Grant is Josh Jackson haha
We’re in a rebuild.
I still can't believe people were calling him a system player and getting upvoted...
a lot came from lakers / raptors / rockets flair.. um i wonder why
No worries. I’ll be saying he’s washed next time he faces a good team. And you can save this message.
[you know it](https://i.imgur.com/GfJNU68.gifv)
Poor Steph everytime he tries to do something cool with his hair he forces himself back to the fro with shitty shooting performances lol
Don’t forget Harden fans
Rockets fans had a lot to say after G1. Real quiet tonight though...
Noticing a lack of Lakers and Rockets flairs in this post, can’t imagine why 🤔
Literally lmfao, it was mostly Lakers flairs
Of course.  Steph almost singlehandedly terminated the goat discussion.  They hate Steph to their guts.
The most ridiculous dumb shit Ive seen on Twitter is mickey mouse rings that Steph won. Homie did not even play in the bubble. LMAO!
He beat the Bulls and Pistons without Blake, Hurray! his legacy is saved!
God forbid he has a poor stretch of basketball and suddenly his whole career is questioned and diminished.
Steph is better than Harden but I think he gets comparable slander
I think people saw him and KD both coming off seasons of not playing due to injuries and with KD looking good in his first two days they figured steph didnt recover the way KD did, reasonable to be concerned but definitely still overreactions
Yeah he's still not getting very good quality shots. A lack of spacing around him to be sure, but probably just as important is the lack of passers around him at the moment. And then also the lack of continuity for the roster. The deadliest Curry is a Curry whose off ball gravity can be leveraged, but right now I think Kerr is trying to simplify things for the rest of the team so it hasn't been as utilized so far.

I expect Draymond's return (if it ever happens) will help him quite a bit.
Well, I'd slow down on that one lol
yea lets slow down on him lol
Ehh, most Wiggins criticism has been warranted.
Hey, if this is a .500 team - through all the crap that's happened to them? That's not a bad season at all.

I'd still like to see them make the playoffs.
Giannis has had 2 awful games, worse than curry's  (one against the Warriors even) and 2 really good games ... you slandering him too?
There were people with warriors flairs in the warriors sub game threads saying that two games ago.
Yeah, Oubre's hands are really good, and he's good at pressuring the ball without fouling
>I mean, it's Detroit.

This is a valid statement for every major sport and I'm so fucking over it
Yeah, that's true - but still, we take those
A lot less motion on offense. Kerr simplified things because guys were thinking too much, I suspect.
I miss jb, so tired of hearing kelenna say “yo” like he ain’t 37
I wish we still had Jim :(
Fitz would mention currys free throw streak every single time he went to the line. And then when he finally misses he’s like “Announcers Curse!! OMG! 2020 bad!!”
It's not you being biased, they are actually the worst in the league.
we concurr
Bro your player named edunkam? Or ebukam? I'm sry I'm forgetting, but Fitz made the same joke twice out of his name. I'm probably far off his name but I know I heard Fitz do it. Hated it
its really awful

jim barnett being gone basically turned the  broadcast full warriors pravda. kelenna doesnt add anything interesting and he sounds corny
Don't worry, I'm sure he will give you plenty of reason lol
Been watching that on Netflix past few days
He cried after fouling out I think. Kid has heart.
He had a tough start but ended up looking hella good, I like the kid (duh), but he never looks happy to me haha.
yeah. hence the carry over to next season. we'll start 0-10.
Prime MJ? Try best player of all time
Curry is one of the more regularly disrespected GOATs around here, goalposts constantly moving to discredit him
LOL bad day for you, kid
He got paid and doesn’t have to practice hard. Plus with the low cost of living in Detroit, he’ll be saving a lot of dough. Whose the real winner?

And we might be able to offload him next year for a couple picks.
Hell yeah. it's only the pistons, but these wins keep the guys confidence up and motivated
Nuggets offered the same contract.
dam i have to do one extra click lmao
Is that why or is it cuz he doesn’t have Klay next to him? We’ll see I guess
Warriors will win fewer than 5 games next month.
>Don't worry man, he might have a cold shooting game in a few days.

And then everyone will say how he's washed and a role player lol
Oh he will have several and plenty of L’s to go with it. But y’all will blame Wiggins and oubre
I've just revived it. Its available here:

[boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com](https://boxscoregenerator.sportsdeck.com/)
generator is down
Cause of covid
and they made it to the playoffs like once Wiggins GOAT
WigGOAT cant win with those cats🙅‍♂️
Bullying works after all
If bullying worked, Wiggins would have been a superstar 3 years ago
Wh.. what kind of inspiration could you gather from him?
already the 3rd best range shooter of the active roster
And cheaper!
Threeanis
Wizaaaard guyy
The anti-gravity bros
No one was good the first two games including Steph.

The are getting better every game and Draymond's still coming.

Warriors will be over .500 this season.
[deleted]
MF carried a no system Marc Jackson Warriors then Kerr came in and unlocked his full potential
I mean there were people saying Dort is a far better player than Ben Simmons yesterday. This sub isn't exactly known for rational thought
In a sense, I suppose they’re not wrong. He IS the system. He makes their motion offense work. The best off ball shooter and shooter to ever play who can also handle the rock and pass. Of course props to the warriors for drafting and building around him with players like klay and Dray who also work very well within it, but let’s not get it twisted Steph and his gravity is the engine of that offense.
Now they’re upvoting you
It's r/NBA most of the people here aren't known for being rational or thoughtful. Every superstar is only known for their last game.
I understand Rockets flairs having this weird chip on their shoulder about Steph but it boggles my mind that fellow Lakers fans do too. Are you just a LeBron fan who joined us after he signed in LA?
Everyone hated on warriors fans but they forgot how bad laker fans were
Guys he just edited his comment to call me a chump :(
Why are Laker fans like this, Mommy?
Imagine being this salty for no reason. Stay pathetic, hoe
It’s gonna be mad funny when the crippled ass warriors bounce your goofy team out the playoffs lol
Why are Bron stans like this?
62 against the Blazers!
Hello!
GoLLden State WWarriors
Westbrook fans were in on the action too lmao don’t let them off the hook
Honestly though can they just move on? It’s a new era - the fourth quarter Wiggins timeline
The harden stans were by far the worst
Normalize tagging people for nephew takes lmao
Cavs flairs too. They busy coming back down to earth after being defeated by Knicks!
Dont let Rockets fans off the hook now
Don’t forget the OKC flairs lmao
Steph has hurt too many fandoms with his dominance from 14-19 lol.
Alot of Hawks flair too
[removed]
I would hazard a guess that the majority of flairs around here are Lakers flairs.
What? I love Curry! Most people in  LA do. He's a great guy
Yeah. Had not it been for Steph Bron would have left MJ miles behind!
who tf are these people who hate steph. im a bron stan and love steph. feel like thags the general consensus
Almost singlehandedly is as dumb of a take as saying Steph is washed. Almost = Kevin Durant. If anything Dirk singlehandedly ended it.
sure but he also choked 3-1 and helped lebron write his masterpiece comeback, which is probably the biggest boost bron’s goat claim has ever had. 

y’all gotta finish the thought to completion damn.
[deleted]
before anything i need to say isc about the goat debate to me pick kareem mj lebron or duncan and place them in any order.

But my eyes must be fucked up you spelled K E V I N D U R A N T as steph. Legit Lebron 100% wins one more and plausibly 2 more if kd doesn't go to GSW. I am not disrespecting steph and his crew they likely win one more maybe 2 more (2019 finals) even if kd never joined them. as for being salty im salty we had a amazing rivalry and western conference, ruined by kd joining the most winning regular season team of all time that was already championship caliber that had a  top 5 in the nba player in 3 of 5 positions before he joined. the fact that steph and kd are easily top 30(probably higher but 30 at worst) all time players made it even more silly
Not really lol, if the lakers get the chip this season and lebron has an average lebron season then I'll personally be sure he's the GOAT. If he does it again next season I think it will be hard for anyone to argue otherwise.
he lost to the Nets and Bucks and didn’t play well in 2 games! he’s a fraud that can only play on superteams !
gotta prove himself by dragging a team to a first round exit, otherwise his legacy is shit
if steph got any where near the amount of % of fouls that harden gets driving to the basket he would be avging 5-6 points more a game
KD is the only major change to the Nets, the Warriors have four players who have been on the team through two full seasons - and two of them currently aren't playing.
reminds me so much of the 05, 06 Kobe situation.
This is the classic one in four games where Wiggins balls out, I still remember seeing him and Embiid come to OU to play Buddy. Wiggins was the better prospect at the time, but even then his motor and engagement were questionable. I wish the dude well tho
hey. i dont wanna hear u talkin shit about prime MJ
Lmfao
Giannis has carried teams without a top 5 shooter playing next to him.
Oubre is talented at many things, it's just the decision making with the ball in his hands and the 3 point shooting deficiencies are amplified greatly playing in Kerr's system
I know he didn't have any assists but he actually was trying to share the ball this game too, saw him pass off a few times instead of forcing the contested layup
I can’t even tell when the jokes end anymore and actual bball talk starts. But I agree
pause
IIRC hes 6'7 with a 7'2 wingspan which is nuts
Yeah I bet he’s really good with his hands I can tell....
I'm sorry, man. Been there, it sucks.
After how bad we looked in those first two games - no shame in losing to the Bucks or Nets on the road, but we looked awful! - I won't complain about any wins at all this year. :)
I think we have the potential to be a great defensive team this year given the length and mobility some of our guys on the roster have, but we need to put in a lot of work on team defense/chemistry first. This is where Draymond can really shine.
He admitted as much in the post-game interview after the Bulls game I think.
They literally just fucking rambled and it sounded like middle school lunch room talk
Lol who gets announcer bias
Impressive
Curry is the most universally disrespected GOAT tier player here. I would say Kobe but I don't see that so much anymore as that's in bad taste for obvious reasons.
Yeah right. Lmao.

Curry is a goat shooter but not a goat player. Stop it.
Not really. My view on Curry remains 100% true until he can perform like this night in and night out.

If he does this the next 20 games, come back and say hello.
he forgot to tell you the true highlight of the day: oubre hit his first 3
*looks at stat sheet* ok sure dude he only shot above 50% from 3 and more than 50% overall this game
RemindMe! 35 days
In 17 games? They'll win at least 9.
Warriors won 9 games in January (and one of the games they were scheduled to play was postponed). But hey, at least you were close! Oh wait, no, I misread that as "8", you actually said "fewer than 5". LOL. Oops.
Are you joking lol, Wiggins and Oubre couldn't hit a fucking barn wall the first 2.5 games, this is some real bait right here
That's what backup generators are for
Bullying builds character! Thanks bullies!

*Sincerely from my parents' basement.*
Charlie Parker didnt become bird until Joe Jones threw a cymbal at his head
He’s never been bullied like what r/Lakers and Lakers Twitter was doing to KCP
Securing the bag on questionable dedication
who's 2?
Yes, one hundred percent. They're starting to sour on DLO now after like ten games. 

The guy got drafted on to one of the worst teams with some of the worst management in the league and still managed to be a central cog in a top ten offense in the league for multiple seasons. 

Wiggins isn't a bad player, he's not a bad guy, and the Timberwolves losing isn't even mostly his fault.
Nah, MJax did have a system: Harrison Barnes isos while Steph and Klay watched wide open in the corners lmao
Ben Simmons is hands down a better player... But man on a lot of team compositions you'd choose Dort because he'll at least shoot.
In that sense, they're not wrong. That's definitely not what people mean when they say someone is a system player though.
steph wont ever get credit he deserves from most nba fans. he doesnt even get it by the refs, ive never seen a superstar make it to the rim and end up on the ground from as much defensive contact he gets and not get calls. he also doesnt get the credit for what he does while he just on the floor, prior to steph unless it was the clock was winding down for each half you never seen anyone guard at half court. he desensitized the nba for a large amount of 3 pointers. he set the nba record for my 3 in a finals game and it was pretty much completely ignored by most
That’s like saying Lebron is a system player in a -drive-and-kick centered system.
He’s jaded all the bandwagoners left for a few years.
They don’t know how good they had it with us!!
All the warriors fans people hated are rocking Lakers flair now anyway
That’s not very polite
[removed]
Lebron* fans lmao i’m pretty sure the actual laker fans like you guys
[deleted]
They can't just like him, they have to revere him as the god of basketball who has no equal - not in the past, not in the present, not in the future.

So they will trash to high heaven anyone who's ever beaten LeBron and find ways to downplay anybody being compared to him.

If they weren't so scared of Jordan and the gigantic mountain of fans and facts backing him up - they'd rag on him too.
insecurity
Still washed.
Some of those posts man. “Steph can’t carry a bunch of bums to the playoffs like Westbrook and Harden can. He’s overrated and was carried by his other all-star teammates.” Like bitch talk to his rangzzz
Lillard and Kyrie fans were there too. Talking mad reckless
They are mad that Steph was the centerpiece of the team that were 4-0 against James Harden and the Rockets in the playoffs. They have an inferiority complex. 

2 MVP > 1 MVP. 

3 Rings > 0 Rings + 0 Finals Appearances
It’s a fact James has played with and won games carrying some absolute bums.

DMo, Joey Dorsey, tariq black, prigioni, Kostas fucking Papanikalous (I’m too lazy to look up the spelling), James ennis, Faried (2019) and the list goes on. 

It’s just nice to see the all omnipotent warriors look mortal for once.
To the God damned Knicks man, tying up my noose as we speak
You right you right, was a lotta Rockets fans in the mix
The harden fans were the most vocal for suuure
Dubs living in their head rent free
I’ll let them off the hook since they won’t be winning shit. It was a one sided rivalry like with the Clippers for a few years.
Yeah oddly hawks flairs too really confusing lol
Our defense is so bad that Steph has been our best defender over 4 games lol. Steph is a good perimeter defender but shouldn't be one of the 2-3 guys on the team who can defend.
> Steph always starts out slow  

That's actually not true lol. As far as I remembered, except for last season, he actually had incredible starts. These years he hasn't been found in his usual spots so he feels a bit off. However, what I consider to be easily his best skill is the ability to always get back up and get hot, even though he starts very slow. He is like Broly in this sense: can start slow, but will finish strong.
Idk, people who don't like basketball or something.
Nah, the warriors basically stopped bron from getting 2-3 more rings. Plus sweeping him in 2018 finals was just pure sweetness.
Yea why couldn’t Lebron drag that young lakers team to the playoff by himself then?  Oh right he was injured so he couldn’t activate “playoff mode” even though he declared it.

When Lebron fails, there is always something.  It’s injury, it’s broken hand, it’s JR, it’s the coach.  But when he wins it’s all about him.  Also his stans would raise every minor thing to belittle their opponents but doesn’t allow others to put any asterisks to their hero’s success.
It’s not only the result but also the fact that the warriors have completely stolen the thunder from the Lebron return.  It was supposed to be the fairy tale of Lebron returning to cavs with yet another super team and supposedly the most exciting team, to then outshone by a team led by a short, weak injury prone player.  I’d also argue without the draymond bs suspension, Lebron wouldn’t have been able to beat the kd-less warriors.

I said almost single handedly because there are a lot of other factors.  There is the great warrior organization, great coach.  Klay dray and others.  And of course Kd later on, but Steph was definitely the catalyst of all of these.  It was skills, but also play style  and personality.  Put for example James Harden at Steph’s spot, would the history be similar or different?  My bet is that it would be worse and kd wouldn’t have joined.
Nope. Honestly MJ has a ton of achievements LeBron will never be able to match. We don't even  have to use the 6-0 reasoning and you can still argue Jordan is the goat. Greatest and most know basketball player of all time.
6/6. 

3+(1)/10.
I love this comment so much you have no idea. I haven't seen the usual Rockets/Lakers flair "CuRrY can'T CaRRY LiKE rUSS And HaRdEn" trademark Steph hater conglomerate.
It's insane that people even rank players based on how well they can play on bad teams, instead of how well they can play on good teams. I thought winning the championship was more important than losing in the first round with mediocre teammates but what do I know
I dont disagree I'm just saying that I can understand why people were overreacting
He was pretty good last game as well
Do you think the fact that he played badly in the first two games is due more to him being not as good, or that he played 5 competitive games in the last 18 months?
Carried to a second round exit, yes
I think Curry would do just fine with Middleton there.
He passed out to Steph for a three at the end! I shed a tear
Well with all the championships recently between the Giants and Warriors and the recent historical success of the Sharks and 49ers unfortunately I'm not sure you have 😅😅
I love it lol. Makes the game more chill for me
Someone in a prev game thread did say it sounded like they were on adderall
steph definitely fucked this guy's mom
Worst take I seen today god damn
Hey remind me how many unanimous MVPs there are again?
he did it in a full season averaging 50/45/90
I was talking about February. Nice try though. Almost had me
Goats win despite bad teamates.

Steph wins and y’all credit him, he loses and it’s his team lol
They're down too. Ballmer shot them all after his last loss
I know the reference but I still read Joe Jonas and it’s making me laugh
I disagree, if you went through the opinions of r/nba you'd think Wiggins was devil in the flesh. Kuzma always got more hate than KCP anyways
Lmao fuck you got me
Lee
Jack iso, Barnes and Biedrens post-ups
Jackson: "Steph and Klay are the best backcourt duo in the league"

Also Jackson: "Barnes I want you to ice out our backcourt"
Fr, its so funny when some ppl say “theyre only good cuz Mark Jackson, Kerr trash coach he didn’t do anything, Curry only good cuz Mark Jackson, etc” when we were actually good cuz of Curry in spite of Jackson’s weird stagnant iso schemes. I bet wed be title contenders in 2013/14 or even 2012/13 if we hired Kerr back then
Why do you hurt me like this? I just got ptsd
Bruh you got me 💀💀💀
[deleted]
My 7 year old will fucking pull the trigger too. Dort shows promise, but in no team would I take him over Ben at this time.
> he doesnt even get it by the refs

Did you see how many scratches he had tonight? Jokic gets those constantly too, but tonight w/ Steph you could actually see skin removed, there just wasn't blood dripping. They were clawing at him all night. Thank god he was efficient w/ his shooting b/c he didn't have the opportunity to get many shots off and had to play more like a traditional PG until he got to score 8 in the 4th (which was overshadowed by Wiggins' explosion for 17 in the 4th).
I’m still here lol.
Lmfao you go right ahead. Even if Curry has a bad game that don't prove shit. Mans got two mvps. What, now players have a bad game and are washed? Lol, bitch please. I'll see you next game fam
My aunt's a Lebron fan and DESPISES Curry. Even roots for him to get injured. It's embarrassing
Bb I like actual Lakers fans too. We got you
I'm probably in the minority but LeBron fan who fucking loves Curry, checking in o/
Lakers fans before Lebron joined weren't salty about the Warriors... there was no rivalry or beef to begin with. We were irrelevant as far as the Lakers were concerned. Now Kings fans from the before times have beef with y'all, but I was largely indifferent to the Kobe/Shaq Lakers, and warmed up to them when Kobe had his bromance going w/ Pau for the 2 chips. After that I became indifferent again b/c we were on the rise, which is something I wasn't accustomed to (I moved to the Bay Area a little after the 'We Believe' team upset of the Dirk Mavs), though I rooted for the young Lakers core.

I appreciate Lebron's greatness, but I'll admit I'm not a big fan of Lebron. If he hadn't joined the Lakers I'd be completely fine w/ the franchise (as a small child I idolized Magic/Kareem), but it's kinda hard to root for the Lakers now that Lebron's there and the young core except Kuz is gone. Like I actually watch Pels games now to check up on them. Still have no animosity towards Lebron, and OG Laker fans are alright in my book.
Dude literally the only reason your team isn’t in the lottery is because lebron wanted to live in LA don’t act like you’re lit or something. You’re really a nephew
We were in the finals 2 years ago lol.
Career high 

W a s h e d

Westbrook carrying his team to 0-4 you hate to see it
Also

“I know it’s only two games into the season but we are not overreacting. Did you see Steph play last year? He sucked”

Yea all 5 games coming off injuries. Literally admitting they just looked up his stats without even looking at his games played... loool
This discussion just turns soo different when you go from Harden to Westbrook lol.
I mean I'm not saying it is a good way to judge him but he hasn't proven he can carry bums to the playoffs because he beat the Pistons and Bulls
They give Steph more crap for beating injured teams than they give Harden for *losing* to them lmao.

Like we still hear more about Curry sweeping the Spurs without Kawhi than we do about Harden shitting the bed and getting blown off the floor by that same team without Kawhi or Parker on his home court in an elimination game.
Sad it has to be that way. Harden is such a good player.
Why didnt you list steph's final appearances too? Always love to see more metrics showing why he's better than harden
In alllllllllll honesty, Harden having Klay and Draymond in their primes would’ve been sick and prob led to the same result.
That's not even the worst Cleveland loss to a New York Clown Fiesta this week, calm down.
Talkin bout how we should take Harden since Steph obviously isn’t happy here
I like how you said Harden fans and not Rocket fans lol
Some of them were convinced how this year's Trae is better than MVP Curry. Don't think it was serious but I found it funny
They think Trae is better than Curry already lol
Yeah, that was ridiculous. I'm all for Trae Young, but I hate disrespecting tenured stars to pump him up.
That's an exaggeration.
Tbh I would claim it possible that it's even worse on offense. Like... if Steph doesn't have the ball... then what? There's basically no other player with any playmaking. They are trying to give the ball to Brad Wanamaker and Juan Toscano-Anderson. This team... is really not looking good. Draymond is the hope for now.
At least wiggins was putting in effort tonight
He def didn’t start out well first year with KD
In his 2nd MVP season he was on fire for the first 25 games or so. Some of the best basketball ever played. They were 24-0. Curry finally cooled off around Xmas and then went insane again in February.
that was as much kevin durant as it was steph curry.

>I said almost single handedly because there are a lot of other factors.

How to contradict yourself 101 a lot of other factors =/= almost single handedly. Literally no (well arguable in Hakeem 2d chip) has "single handedly won a chip. MJ needed pippen Lebron needed dwade, shaq and kobe, LA kareem and magic, need I continue?

As for Harden in for steph, assuming ker is still the coach harden has succeeded in dan antoni systems. While sure the likely don't win 73 games its very easy to say the still win a couple chips between 2015-2020 and it's 100% if KD comes.

as for the dray suspension, then you agree that no injuries 2015 gsw lose as they took 6 games to win and obviously 2015 gsw<2016 gsw despite the finals L. 

Then your talking team shit as outshining a single player. Sure kd gsw is on a short list of the goat team(s) and w/o kd is most winning team regular season. However saying any play on that team was better or played better than Lebron means you are beyond biased.


Lastly the 2016 finals was a fairytale ending, fuck im not even a bron stan but to pretend a 1-3 comeback against  on of the greatest teams in nba history for cleavlend first sports win in over half a century is silly. Fuck that's more impressive then say winning 2 chips with the goat shooter the number 2 player in the league, 2 all defensive players one who is a top5 all time shooter and the other is a DPOY.
acheivements so bill russel is the goat then. Or maybe wilt if you mean individual over team. Or kareem and duncan had a shit ton of acheivements to rival mj and Lebron. Or maybe there are mire metrics for who the goat than achievements. especially in a team game.
Most known, sure, but I'd love to hear the achievements you failed to list
The average NBA player is better today than back then, that's true for basically every sport due to scientific and technological advances, the fact that lebron has been in the finals that many times is fucking amazing idk how you dont see that. Not to mention the longevity of his career, he's a better passer and elevates his team more than Jordan. Jordan never dragged an awful team to the finals either, this is the weakest argument that people still cling on to and it's kind of amusing
He’s been pretty good outside of the first two games
I think Curry’s skills as an individual aren’t debatable. 

What’s debatable is how far he can carry a team of this caliber
Giannis has never been to a conf finals eh? 

You just start watching the nba
I was telling him to do it, and he listened. Tear was shed as well
Us A’s Raiders and pre-Lacob Warriors fans definitely have
If he is an Oakland fan he does, raiders haven't won shit since the 80s and the a's were 89 as well
The Sharks haven't ever won a title. It took them 25 years before they even made it to the Cup Finals, and they've only made it to that one finals.

They put out a consistently good team (only missed the playoffs seven times in 28 seasons), but it never feels like they put out a great team.

The Sharks have been getting my hopes up and then dashing them ever since I watched my first playoff game (which was actually my introduction to the NHL) back in 1994.
I’m an East Bay Warrior fan... grew up rooting for the A’s, Raiders, and Warriors. It’s been rough! Fucking Raiders, man
can i introduce you to the raiders
I’m sure it’s great for that age group
Which of the other goats have 3 rings but no finals MVP?
20 games...come holla at me.
Well your comment was in December so I guess you just don't know what months are then. This might help: [https://www.calendar-365.com/2021-calendar.html](https://www.calendar-365.com/2021-calendar.html)

Let me know if you have any questions!
Steph didn't play good those games, and Wiggins and Oubre were also awful. It was the first two games. After injury and not playing in a very long time.
Lebron shouldn't have been swept in 2018 by the Warriors. Goats win despite bad teammates. Braindead take.
How salty is your juice box?
Idk why, but I believe you
I thought it was Morey after the bots betrayed him.
It was really bad when prison kcp was a thing
The talent's there, but I think those playoff series against the Nuggets and the Spurs were really invaluable in helping our core develop into the vets that they became.
It's possible, although Iggy (and Livingston, Barbosa) were really key pieces, and we didn't have Iggy until 2013-2014. Then again, in 2012-2013 Bogut was healthy during the playoffs, and we actually got past the 1st round and took the Spurs to 6, so it's possible. Really the key to unlocking full potential was Dray starting, playing more minutes, and playmaking (not just his defense). 2012-2013 was Dray's rookie season so I'm not sure he would've gotten us over the hump even if he started. 2013-2014 I think we at least get past the Clippers, since we took them to game 7 w/ no prep from Jackson and had Iggy, but the main problem would've been Bogut being out for the entire playoffs. If Bogut were healthy in 2013-2014 with Kerr at the helm, seeing how the Spurs beautiful basketball completely destroyed the Heat in the Finals, I think we would've had a shot.
Hey man, you cannot disrespect the caterpillar and rave about the butterfly.
Brian Shaw cross-matched Nate Robinson on Klay and Curry was on fire, Jackson posts Klay up 50 times in the 2nd half and they blew a 16+ point lead to lose by double digits
na i didnt get to watch the game i was busy, and that doesnt surprise me the smallest degree possible. its has to be refs as a whole that have made the decision not to because he rarely will ever get more than 6 free throws and its not uncommon for him to get 0-2
Hey, I like you buddy
<3 gave me good ball to watch while we were ass honestly laker fans have no reason to hate warrior fans
yeah i feel you i’m definitely a fan of Lebron but some of the people who are just only Lebron fans really hate anyone who’s ever faced him and beat him
Last season the Lakers didn't have a single player that they drafted and there's dudes who act like that.

I know some people have blinders on when it comes to pointing out their team's weaknesses - but some of these Lakers fans are straight up blindfolded.
[deleted]
I even read posts on here where people said Curry is not even a top 10-15 player in the league anymore lmfao.
The pinnacle of basketball achievement is carrying your team to a first round exit
Totally fair, but the track record speaks for itself. People forget Steph hasn't had a superteam his whole career. It's weird to claim he can't carry a team only 2 games into a season vs 2 of the best teams in the league while playing with a brand new team. The 2 more recent games are much better ways to judge how he'll do for the season. The guy's never had a full season shooting below 40% from 3 for a reason.
The first season after the Warriors got rid of Monta, Steph took the spurs to 6 games in the western conference semis with David Lee as his 2nd option and a rookie Draymond who came off the bench for 13 minutes a game. Pretty good for his first season as the number one.

This whole "Steph can't carry scrubs to the playoffs" is so overdone anyways. Who other than Lebron has actually carried scrubs to the playoffs and done well in recent years? 

Westbrook certainly didn't. He had teammates like PG13, Oladipo, Adams, Schröder and they still got bounced in the first round every single time. Harden is the closest but unlike some people here like to believe, he also never had scrub teammates. He put up insane numbers but he also played with Dwight, Capela, Ariza, EG, CP3 and last year he had Westbrook.

Nobody carries a team full of scrubs to the playoffs by himself...
78 years old Ginobli blocking the fuck out of harden from his wheelchair is top 5 playoff moment of the decade
this is factual and I am forever mad about it
My favorite of Harden pulling that was 2016.

Curry, the unanimous MVP played half of game 1 and half of game 4 and that's it, and Harden's Rockets got eliminated in five - their one win coming in game 3 by all of 1 point.

Klay and Draymond were enough to beat Harden and Dwight Howard.
I agree. He’s the best iso-player I’ve ever seen. Honestly might be the best volume scorer I’ve ever seen. But I’d always take Steph over him if my team needs a ring.
Being fair, they damn near had us once.
No way a Draymon-Harden lockerroom could coexist. Draymonds traded out in 2 seasons max
Lmfao you thought I was being serious?
Lol who the fuck said that. I’m a diehard Rockets homer and I’m in this thread. Let me hear it
god damn right i am, tilman can ligma if he thinks im going to follow a team under his cheap ass ownership. same reason I'm Detroit born and raised but am not a lions or pistons fan. No reason to support a poorly ran franchise.
Of course, but as soon as he hit his 13 threes (I think the 5th or 6th game), it went smooth from there on. Still the major points is that he usually starts strong.
that february span was otherwordly. He was making threes at a ridiculous rate. He was making 10+ threes/ game for like 4 straight games, including his signature game against OKC.
oh yeah, that was a combined effort.
He’s the center of everything no?  Without him there would be no warrior dynasty no?  Then there would be a cavs dynasty under the Lebron super team no?  Then Lebron would probably have a winning record in the final instead of losing one no?  

And I am not even arguing that Steph is better than Lebron, but his existence as the center of the warrior dynasty, stopped Lebron from being the unicorn of his generation, which put Lebron much further away from the discussion of goat vs mj.  At the end of the day, if you cannot kick everyone’s asses in your generation.  How can you be goated?
Just search wikipedia and you'll see most if not all of them.
I'm not a fan either, but I like that it makes you angry.
lmao so it's doing well in the 30s bracket?
Not every team is blessed with a Blaha bro
But Julius Erving, David Robinson, Oscar Robertson
I count MVP as higher than Finals MVP
ignorant
Thanks for your help but I can afford to lose track of time, i'm not a slave to the clock.  Good luck with that tho.
You said it. Brain dead.
People here don’t remember jailbird 17mil KCP and how ruthlessly he was roasted before Lebron came
Thats true but I think Kerrs motion offense definitely wouldve got us past the Clippers in 2014.
That Nuggets series is what got me to start following basketball outside of the playoffs.
Pretty sure we had zero centers by the end of that series after Glen Davis tackled Jermaine O’Neal at the knees.
He got 8 FTs last night, 4 from driving to the rim, 3 when D Rose fouled him on a 3 point attempt, and 1 tech for when the Pistons player that fouled him on a drive pounded the ball and raised his hand in frustration (think they started auto teching those last season?). 

In the Bulls game he got 9 FTs. 

He's been driving to the rim to draw contact more this season than I've seen him do in a long time and logging what would be considered earlier series playoff type minutes for him, so if he has to do this for too much longer not sure how his body's gonna hold up, even though he looks as conditioned as ever. He just isn't built for that type of game. Thankfully Wiggins seems to have plenty of stamina.
r/nba doesn’t tho
Both Californian teams. No reason to hate!
LeBron is getting outplayed by a fucking Beyblade this season.
You are an unlikable person. Congratulations on you team’s recent dominance tho
Curry is TOP 5 and he ain't 5th.  
  
He's like 3rd or 4th
How the fuck is that fair? Who has actually carried bums to playoffs other than LeBron?

I agree that Westbrook's 2017 thunder roster was a less than optimal team. It's one thing to say that he dragged them to playoffs, which is totally true, and a totally different thing to call starting quality players like Steven Adams and Andre Roberson "bums". Warriors are literally hanging on to g-leaguers right now as bench pieces and Damion lee has to make deciding plays. 

It's one thing to be a star player with a quality team but no other stars on your roster. Steph proved that he can do something with that type of team from 2012-14 before Klay's emergence.
>Who other than Lebron has actually carried scrubs to the playoffs

Exactly, this 100%

It's like everyone is calling a non-star player, a scrub. Harden's teams are far cry from scrubs.
The first season after monta Steph still had Lee averaging 18/11 and Klay averaging 16 on 40% from 3. Also Landry was great off the bench that year. In no way was he asked to do as much as let's say 05-06 Lebron. 

I'm not saying Steph sucks or isnt a top player but he has never had a roster near as bad as that and carried them. This is the closest he has gotten and it still is a better roster. 

All my post said is that Steph beating Detroit and Chicago doesn't mean he can carry a bad team to the playoffs. That's it. I even said that isnt a good way to judge a player.
I'd take a lebron, steph, kd, kawhi and probably giannis over harden every time for any reason personally, maybe even AD too. Harden just doesn't have some X factor that I cant place my finger on, it feels like his heart just isnt in it quite as much as the other guys I listed. Maybe I'm crazy but theres just something about harden that makes me want to avoid him regardless of how good his stats are. He's also a little gimmicky for my taste
You think Harden is a better iso player than KD? I feel like people confuse all of Harden's opportunities to shoot with greatness. If KD played like Harden, I'd bet a limb on KD outperforming. That's not to mention Kobe and MJ.
I mean usually losing to the knicks is cause for that reaction, just the Jets beat you to the punch.
*HE WANT'S NAMES, GOD DAMNIT!*
I hope some day you guys get an awesome owner. I never thought we'd get out of Chris Cohan, but miracles happen I guess.
exactly, i’m responding to the guy saying steph single handily stopes lebrons goat claim.
>He’s the center of everything no1?  Without him there would be no warrior dynasty no2?  Then there would be a cavs dynasty under the Lebron super team no3?  Then Lebron would probably have a winning record in the final instead of losing one no4?  

1. If you want to play hypotheticals and such we can. Frankly if you just put a good point guard in gsw they are still a legit threat. 2. Likely not a dynasty unless the pg is also an allstar tier if then there is still a chance. and ofc if kd comes they going to 3 finals winning at least one likely 2 maybe 3.

3 Also depends, assuming no steph but kd in the 17 finals its a tough call but i say it goes to 7 as kd dra klay is already a scary as fuck team, but without knowing the pg its too tough to call. Then if kyrie leaves i don't think Lebron wins the 18 finals with that cavs team that without him is a fucking lottery team. Imagine the 2d 3peat bulls without pippen sure they are still good but idk if they win the finals. 

4. Its a better finals record definitely but  idk by how much, like lets say that the thunder go to the 15 finals and love andd kyrie still get injured. Frankly cavs lose 1 with there 2 and 3 man injured as every nba team would do. Then in 18 if kyrie leaves then the cavs  likely lose to the rockets. sure 2/4 looks better than 1/4 for that split, but as you will see in my response to your other paragraph the best player in basketball, or any team sport, does not always win.

>And I am not even arguing that Steph is better than Lebron, but his existence as the center of the warrior dynasty, stopped Lebron from being the unicorn of his generation, which put Lebron much further away from the discussion of goat vs mj.  At the end of the day, if you cannot kick everyone’s asses in your generation.  How can you be goated?


Wait wait wait Lebron isn't the unicorn bc he lost in the finals? If you want to use finals wins as the only goat metric then its bill russel, but most people can realise in a team game the best player can lose due to having a bad team. Non Lebron examples, Mj pre pippen as he only made it to 6 finals bc he always lost before the finals, Kareem every year he didn't win in his prime,wilt losing to russels celtics ect ect ect. 

Lebron still kicked everyone of his generations asses he is still the clear number 1 player of this era and a top 4 all time in the goat discussion. The same way Jordan getting bullied by the bad boys or losing to the celtics doesn't mean he was not the best player on the court. Its the same that Lebron had 0 chance of winning every finals he lost save the mavs L. When your 2d best player is fucking deledova or mo williams (pre kd final loses) or you are fscing a team with 4 all stars, two who are mvp level, no shit he aint winning. Unless you honestly think that MJ on those cavs team or the old Miami team wins those finals, and spoiler no single player change has them win those finals. 

Finally ask anyone who the best player of this generation is, and guess what its LBJ.
The classic, "I dont actually know what I'm talking about go look it up" excuse. Go wikipedia's Bron's achievements, they're the two greatest players for different reasons but bron is slowly taking the lead which makes sense when he's already played a few more seasons than jordan. Whatever man, there will always be idiots who cling on to jordan as the GOAT. There could be a player who leads their team to 7 rings over 8 finals appearances in a 10 year span and some dumbass will still go "they're not 6 for 6, jordan was better"
It doesn’t make me angry?
In blahas name we pray amen
Top 20 guys, none are top 10 IMO.
That’s plain stupid... why would leading a team to a chip be worth less than being the best regular season player? And even then he’s only got 2 MVPs.
11 games short. Little man.
It's literally the dumbest take. Literally no player has won without good teammates.
I know Mo Buckets is more of a jump shooting 4 than a true 5, but I guess he would've had to make do. Draymond was starting by game 5 anyway alongside Lee, so I think if Kerr had been at the start of the helm in 2012-2013 the results would've probably stayed the same, maybe get to a game 7 against the Spurs. But we'd probably get past the Clippers. With what happened in reality, with Bogut and O'Neal out for the 2nd round we definitely don't get past OKC (hell we barely managed in 2016). That's why my hypothetical was if Bogut were healthy, I think w/ Kerr we could've had a real chance at contending for a title a year earlier. 2 years earlier is a stretch w/ a rookie Draymond.
i was more so talking about his career, there is cases of that happening a few times in a streak. in 2018-19 he got a total of 10 double digit free throw games. funny thing is in the playoffs until the game after kd got hurt he didnt get a single game with double digits but after every single game but 1 did he get at least 8 free throws each game. 

https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01/gamelog/2019 look at the game logs for free throws

in 16-17 curry only got double digit FT's 4 times through the whole season, he had more games with 0 than double digit
David Lee as the second option, sophomore Klay, and a rookie Draymond who barely got minuts is not a horrible team but as far as carrying bad teams to the playoffs goes this is as bad of a team that you can expect to make the playoffs and he took them to the semis and did well against the Spurs. 

> In no way was he asked to do as much as let's say 05-06 Lebron.

> doesn't mean he can carry a bad team to the playoffs.

That's the point. I'm not saying Steph can carry scrubs to the playoffs, I'm saying that nobody other than prime Lebron (and maybe 2006 Kobe) could. Everyone is talking as if carrying bad teams is just what superstars do when nobody else has actually done it. They all had at least decent rosters, definitely not scrubs and certainly way better players than what the Warriors were fielding last year for example.
05-06 LeBron isn't the best example. That was a 42 win team the year before, and adding LeBron turned them into a 50 win team.

07-08 was more of a carry. I'd go with that season. 45 wins and he still got them to the second round.
KD being better purely as a volume scorer I'd agree he has almost 0 weaknesses in his scoring game, but with but neither Kobe or MJ had the 3pt range that Harden has which is always going to be more efficient than a midrange which both specialised in.
In the regular season an argument could easily be drawn, but not playoffs when fouls aren’t called as frequently
I mean we were missing our top four receivers, that said our defence looked weak as hell, our run game wasnt taking off (I think we should have tried running a little more even though it was getting stopped decently) and the jets just had a real solid game, perfect storm to take an L but oh well, we'll see how the next game goes
ya I want the fords gone from the lions more tbh. They have wasted the careers of too many all time great players, even though i definitely watch more b-ball.
Cries in the locker room of cavs while kicking asses I guess.  

Dumb ass.
Uh no. Look dude I'm not gonna be wasting my time arguing with someone on the internet on who the GOAT is. We don't have to use the rings argument to even prove that MJ is better. Just the fact that MJ was a 10x times scoring champ, a DPOY, steals leader, etc should be enough.  LeBron ain't taking the lead lol. Not with that choke against the Mavs. Not with that superteam bullcrap. Not with all that flopping. LeBron wins one ring with another top 5 player in the NBA named Anthony Davis and LeBron fans start calling him the GOAT. Hilarious.
I disagree
You can't lead a team to a chip without being the best player, plus he already got one chip without Durant, without Steph the team gets no where, with Steph alone the warriors are one of the best offenses
ignorant
[deleted]
Yeah, I think it was just a horrible matchup against DJ and Blake. Speights couldn’t really pretend to guard them, and the only person listed as a C who was still active was Kuzmic, who was tall but way too thin and very unskilled.
The fact that you are using Dray at all shows you didn't watch that team. Dray was maybe the 9th best player on the roster. Lee was an all star for a reason that year and Klay was already one of the best shooters in the league. Landry was also one of the better bench bigs in the league

Id say Harden did it in his first year in Houston. Westbrook has more of an argument than steph for the year after durant left as well. Oladipo was mediocre that year.
You have no clue what you are talking about lol. Lebron was there the year before and carried them to 42 wins as a 2nd year player.
KD probably a better iso scorer too since he's taller longer and can get off shots that are unblock able, if Harden has the range on KD but KD dont really need the range.
Good response really argued my points. Accept it didn't. Looking as your out if arguements and ive shit on all of yours id reccomend you watch some more basketball, before talking bullshit. :^) have a good day.
Lmao lebron has AD MJ had pippen, your argument holds no water. It really boils down to what I said, the NBA as a whole is filled with better players today than it was in the 90's due to way better understanding of diet, exercise, recovery, the technology to analyze games, technique, etc. Were people fawning over the best high school players in Jordan's day the way they do now? The skill level in every sport increases over time. The best golfer today is better than the best golfer of last generation. The best rock climbers today are climbing routes that were called impossible 20 years ago, etc. The fact that lebron has been the best player in the league for over a decade, in a league full of players that are just better than the players in Jordan's generation is all you need to know to understand he is the better player. It's okay to put on your rose tinted glasses and struggle to let go of the past, but it's just a simple fact of athletics, every generation is better than the last and the greatest player of this generation is better than the greatest player of last generation. You'll figure it out eventually I hope
He's not doing it night in and night out, and just took an L.

Im living in your head rent free, its pathetic.

I literally have no recollection of our convo, yet you keep coming back here.
Yes, the take that obviously stemmed from your stupidity is obviously terrible
And yet the series went a full 7 games w/ Mark Jackson basically panicking out there.
Yeah, you're right.

I don't know why I was thinking that was his rookie season.
Lol. Do you seriously think MJ wouldn't dominate the league today? MJ was drinking and partying a lot and still dominated. If MJ played today and got the technology and science available to players today he'd probably be an even bigger monster than who he was in his era. Your argument holds no water too, and besides, it's not like the AD argument is the only thing I gave you. Bron fans really like cherry picking huh.

Tell me when LeBron gets the amount of physicality MJ and the 90s players recieved. Ever heard of Jordan rules? I've never heard someone even mention something similar like that about LeBron. Sure LeBron is probably the better athlete, but when it comes to pure skill set, footwork, competetiveness, how beautiful and graceful one's game is, MJ beats LeBron. There's a reason why the Golden Age of the NBA was during Mike's era, and not today. Not replying anymore to you boy, finish that homework and hope you have a great day.
and you keep commenting too. you are an ignorant. the Warriors are 12-11 and the Mavs 10-14. who's carrying more? ignorant. 2 days ago he not needed to be in the 4th quarter against your team. and he's 5th in ppg. so yes, he's doing it night in and out
You’re so angry
I'll give you MJ being more graceful but he wouldn't be able to dominate in a league with lebron, I'd love to see his face getting chasedown blocked by lebron. I've literally watched dozens of old bulls games, MJ is just the second greatest of all time, simple as that. Lmao at "boy", idk if you're racist or just simple but either way I hope something good happens to you today and your mood gets turned around buddy
L
I'm really not angry at all. You just said something stupid so I mocked you.
>night in and night out

 night in and night out, ignorant
I honestly thought it would be a lot longer after LeBron left for the Cavs to be fun again lol this year kicks ass so far
I know the Pistons aren’t good team (no offense Pistons fans), but I think the Cavs are making the playoffs.  I know it’s early and I’m being optimistic, but this is a pretty good Cavs team.  They’re young and growing at almost every position.  Gaining chemistry and consistency.  Surprising 90% of people, Bickerstaff is doing a really good job.  They’ve got real depth too which is extra helpful in this crazy environment with Corona, not to mention injury.
Man, Drummond is just a roller coaster to watch
Sexton just built different 😤💯🔥
Not too shabby that the throw-in with Jarrett Allen is giving us 12.6 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 3.8 APG, and adding in a steal and block per game on 48.7/50/87.5 shooting splits through 5 games.

Thanks again, Brooklyn.
Great game for Sexton, he was lights out. Also, not that it's relevant but I never really processed that the Pistons can almost run a lineup of just top 5 picks when healthy between Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Josh Jackson, and Jahlil Okafor.
In 2k I had always found it unrealistic that players could miss that many easy layups, and then I watched Andre Drummond
pistons only beat good teams... 

shit.


fun game for us. Okoro did great tonight, looking like a pure glue guy who does it all and makes the hustle plays. if his scoring gets up, gold.
i really like this team
Sexton is actually maybe kinda sorta interestingly an all star?
Dang. I figured theyd win but not by so much
Drummond can be so frustrating to watch
I gotta see Drummond's poster again god damn
Sexgod
Cavs 1 game out of 2nd in the East 👀
I really want the Cavs to make the playoffs
Fuck all this "free beal" talk, get my mans Rose up outta there.
Pistons will not appear in the playoffs this decade at this rate
I honestly thought we would struggle to win 15 games this season and tank for Cade Cunningham. I am also ashamed to admit that I wanted to trade Garland in order to make room for Cade. I've never been so happy to eat crow!
I was pretty sure we were tanking for Bronny
I put $200 down on our win total because I thought we’d be better than last year, but I wouldn’t have dreamt of being a .500 team that plays defense the way we do.
Legit good team. Not a playoff team, probably, but good.
I was so meh on Bickerstaff but he really has our team playing so hard. Earlier in the offseason he said he wants us to be a team that can win 4 or 5 games a year simply from out-hustling the other team. I think we've already seen that a few times.

I also wish we coulda seen this team in the bubble that coulda been fun.
We’ll see. Right now we’re in and Toronto and Miami are out but we all know they’re capable. I think we’ll at least make the play-in tourney.
The real key here is gonna be health. They haven't been full strength practically all year. And I don't mean they'll be way better when K Love is back, I'm talking about getting starter's minutes from Nance, Sexton, Garland, and Okoro in addition to the kickass big man rotation, all at the same time for a consistent stretch of games.

If they can get and stay healthy, I really think they've got a shot at the playoffs. They play incredibly hard and they're creating a winning identity. The effort alone makes even their losing games worth watching. I am loving this team and can't wait to see what comes next.
No need to apologize, we're trying to be bad for once. We're finally succeeding at failing vs failing to succeed
Playoffs or at the very least the play in tourney
> I know the Pistons aren’t good team (no offense Pistons fans)

Wanna fight
You're a shoe in for the play in tournament at the very least.
Detroit is probably the least talented team in the league, lol.

I do agree that CLE may be making the playoffs this year.

...unfortunate in my mind, but the roster is good enough to do it.
Somebody needs to make him stop watching Jordan and Kobe highlights.
The Drummond giveth and the Drummond taketh awayeth.

But this season mostly giveth.
When I started watching this game he went on a run that included like four missed shots right at the basket, two of which were reverse layup attempts and two turnovers. If you are the biggest guy on the court WHY ARE YOU ATTEMPTING REVERSE LAYUPS??? He had multiple missed dunks in this game. Multiple times someone tried to pass to him in the post and he just fumbled it out of bounds. I don't think there's ever been a player in my life that has been this frustrating to watch. He went 9-24 today. HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE WHO GETS POINTS THE WAY HE DOES?!?!?! And the highs just make it worse, because he has the skills to be an All-NBA player, it's just unfortunate that those skills were paired with one of the lowest basketball IQs in the league. I wish we could see what would happen if you put LeBron's brain in Drummond's body for a game.
His defense is nutty when he tries. Dude really needs to be consistent and he’s easily an all-star. Really interesting decisions coming up for Koby
If he had any post moves, he’d be ridiculous.
Cavs definitely won the Harden trade
So many long versatile two way wings.
“When healthy”
Windler and Okoro looking better by the game
Oh shit. What does that mean for us?
>Sexton is absolutely undoubtedly definitely unquestionably an all star.

FTFY
If the Cavs are in the playoff hunt, he has to be right?
How is he not at least a reserve all star at this point? The team is winning, he's been the best player on the team, and he's been putting up great numbers with nice efficiency.
Y'all let Canada down today
Because he can be so good he just doesn’t put it all to use all the time
>I wanted to trade Garland in order to make room for Cade. I've never been so happy to eat crow! 

Damn dude haha. You envisioned a very dark timeline.
you weren't necessarily wrong to want it, probably increases our ceiling long term

unpopular opinion around here, but winning this year is going to end up being very limiting for this team
The Garland/Sexton pair will be questionable if they’re not performing.  They’re both growing and developing well though!
Bickerstaff has been so good this year. Crazy to think we went from John Belien to this!
Yeah, this is the realistic take. I think we’re in the play-in bubble.

A part of me is also sad we’re not on the Cade train, but whatevs. Sexton for life!
It's crazy.  At one point I think Dotson was the only guard on our active roster for like a week and a half.  The most consecutive games we've had with the same starters is three, and that lineup had multiple backups playing.  It's crazy Bickerstaff had gotten the consistent level of play he has with the rosters he's had available.
Fierce competition with Whiteside for lowest BBIQ.
I would pay Drummond but i would probably prefer a 3+1 team option contract.
Nets got the best player but considering what we gave up we did really well.
We are legitimately like 11 deep at this point
Okoro with consistently good offense will make us a top 5 team in the east
I'm so happy to see Windler on court. Theres so many players to be excited about on this team. I like the whole crew.
There are about 20 players who deserve to make the all star game in each conference. It’ll be interesting for sure.
He has to at least make the reserves
Man I really wanted to win today, it's just a shame th-

> Y'all let Canada down today

Well, I guess some good came out of this game
We just gotta get rid of these plays were he thinks he’s Kyrie Irving and he’s about to do an acrobatic reverse 360 layup
r/clevelandcavs can be a dark place when LeBron isn't around (until this season started)
Crazy to think that it took so many tries before someone gave him a head coaching job.
I told everyone Beleins awful offensive sets were why Sexton wasn't being utilized properly and lo and behold... but I was crazy back then.
There's still a pick coming our way from whichever big not named Nance or Allen we trade!
Man I love Drummond too, if he didn’t do all the wild shit he does I think he could be a top 3 big in the league just because he’s a rebounding god, but holy shit. He’ll probably want more than Allen will get and with Allen there are so many less wasted offensive possession. I’m not sure how Drummond ended the game but I saw he shot like 6/18 at one point, that’s just slightly above shitty 3-point percentage let alone in the post. I hope we start giving Allen starter minutes since to me he’s clearly the future.
I hope we keep him for at least 3 more years. Fucking love that guy.
Yeah, I’m finally getting the idea of what Altman wants. It feels like there is a KPJ sized hole in the line up right now though. A bigger guy that can really create.
Which is precisely why I stay the hell away from there hahaha.
Soon, Cave Culture will be the envy of the league!
I think the idea should be to keep either Love or Drummond. Allen and Nance are clear priorities.
Honestly Tauren Prince has filled that role really really well
I can't fault you there lol. But it has chilled out for this season at least. Winning helps keep a lot of idiot takes like mine at bay
A culture driven by young players who work hard and a new coach and it’s working?  Sign me UP
Is that similar to the early hunter-gatherer culture?
Allen and nance are definitely obvious keepers. Can we afford to keep Drummond or Love. Cause Allen is getting paid this coming year and I think Sexton the year after that. If we keep Garland we’ll have to pay him a pretty penny just not the max sexton is gonna get. I’m not sure what our cap looks like in the near future with all these pay days coming up.
Keep Drummond, Allen and nance imo. Love is washed.
I think we will likely see some big movement.

Realistic, mcgee and drummond for pick and an expiring

Bonkers shit: love, mcgee, Drummond and our pick for beal
He's been so much better than advertised
Prince has been great 3 and D but he doesn't create.  Likewise with Windler, who has played much better than a #26 pick.


We're really missing someone who can reliably attack the hoop with a big enough body to dominate smaller guys.  Like a Jimmy Butler type.
You might be right. It’d just be nice to have one of the wings at the top of the draft (or KPJ having worked out at a high level).
Level headed idiotic takes I can handle. Others on there not so much lol
Yes but with more scrappy defense and Drummond post ups
You *may* not be able to choose.
Okoro will be that guy
Yeah I'm hoping that's true in the long run.  It's pretty clear the plan this year is to make him a defensive star, but I'm assuming once he reaches that point in his development we're gonna switch over and help him be more aggressive and body other players.
Wow this thread really dry huh?
Dubs a dub
I feel like Patrick Williams has crazy good potential
The worst offensive display of the Pistons so far this season and that says a lot. Just goes to show how much shooting and spacing is needed in today's NBA something which the Pistons lack severely when Ellington isn't playing and Bey is having a bad game. Oh well, strap in soldiers the tank rolls on!
This game occurred indeed
Detroit going 16% from 3 tonight god damn
That game was pretty dry ngl
Let’s leave Golden State out of this
Still mad Arturas stole him from Troy. Well played, Arturas.
Those are tanking numbers!
We want Cleveland
This tank is going fantastically. 3 close losses, Josh Jackson and Jerami Grant look great.
Our shooters really carried us through that bumpy ride. Good game detroit
Clint Capela exists
We lose this game the past 2 seasons.
Legitimately a bad 8 point win lol

fuck it we take it baby first 3 game win streak since ???
Mann GG Atlanta we went to war with y’all but you guys are solid
I like Detroit’s announcers. Super chill and had a lot of fair takes
Rondo is literally the perfect backup for Trae jesus Christ he was wildin' today, shotout to Bogi aswell who finally showed up
Lots of ugly reffing (on both sides) and ugly defense, especially from the Hawks. Thank god for our great shooting from three. Really shouldn't have allowed it to get that close against the Pistons without DRose and Blake, especially after going up 24 at the start of the fourth. Grant and Jackson played great though, and once Hayes figures out his shot selection he'll be very good. Stewart was killing us on the boards. 

Great outing from Rondo, love to see our bench actually contributing when last year it was the ghost of Vince Carter and Brandon Goodwin getting spanked by every other team's second string
can we give some love to trae’s galaxy brain timeout?
I'm used to hating Rondo. Now I love Rondo. 
A lot.
Can we stop linking to the box score and go back to including it in the post? why did that change?
This Hawk team is deeper than a clowns pocket!
Rebounding and turnovers made this game a lot closer than it should've been. I'm impressed with how hard the Pistons played being without Blake and Rose especially when they went down big. Also, props to Stewart. He killed us with his offensive rebounding.
Pistons played a lot harder than us. Happy to get the win and our offense looked amazing during some stretches. Can’t be caught slipping like we did in that last quarter though
Pistons are probably gonna get a top 5 pick this year and that’d honestly be a great thing for them cause maybe they can get their future star there to pair with their current young players
Really sloppy game from us, but we got the W so all is well. Next two games are going to be the first big test for us to see exactly how good this team is.
Hox are a fun team. I like how Tree throws ball in the hoop good. We win game well. Bill Simmons can eat my ass
Hawks going 72-0
Rondo had some very very nice passes in his Hawks debut tonight and he even hit a couple big shots. Having a competent NBA ball handler while Trae is on the bench is a revelation for us.
THE EAST RUNS THROUGH ATL
2020 Hawks > 1996 Bulls
I really look forward to seeing this team at full strength. Solid win tonight.
Not gonna lie those passes from Rondo got me hard. I'm a full 2 inches right now
Remember when Trae was a bust
Trae is good at basketball in my opinion
GG Detroit, was hella intense at the end
trae is such a closer bro
THE HAWKS WANT BAMA!
Salute to Detroit, they could’ve mailed it in after the big deficit, but they kept playing hard. I like #28 a lot
Trae Young MVP
Trae couldn't even break 30, sad
One of the worst officiated games for both sides in a long time.
Maybe this will be the season Trae gets recognized as a top 10 player and not just empty stats on a bad team.
We’re winning it all.
That was Traes first 3 game win streak of his career! We da best MUSIC!! GG Detroit
Man, Pistons played HARD today. Shoutouts Stewart. He's a bulldog too
Hox
HaWWWks looking good to start
All I gotta say is fuck Grayson Allen
I’m happy with this game. We played our young guys. Also jearmi grant is better than people think
Up Next trae dropping 40 on kyries head
Rondo lettin Trae pad those empty stats at the end
Rondo is so good man. He came in and owned the game.
Easily our most enjoyable game.

Loved seeing Hayes get to run the offense at the end of the game. Stewart had great energy too.

Big scoring game from Josh Jackson but I think his actual impact is a little questionable because he has pretty bad tunnel vision. He doesn't really play within the rest of the team.
The formatting on this post title could be a bit better. Atlanta is the winner, so their score should be first.
damn man trae has 46 free throws through the first 3 games, that’s ridiculous
2020 Hawks greatest team to ever touch the ball. What a time to be alive
This is the first time I see the losing score placed first "120-128" instead of 128-120
Cleveland vs Hawks ECF.
Love it. Another competitive loss.
Hawks are one of my favorite teams!
Collins looks really unmotivated out there. He is getting into foul trouble so quickly. He looks frustrated with not getting enough touches and isn't putting effort on the defensive end. 

Maybe the extension negotiations falling through have something to do with or Atlanta's new signings. It's only been 3 games, but hope he turns it around soon.
Trae Young will be better than Stephen Curry
That to was clutch af. Lets just say that was a ‘Brain Young’ moment.
Hawks are supa hot fire rn
Cavs wya?
Game was kinda ugly again, but we take those. 3-0 baby!
Keep in mind that Atlanta is 3.42-0 in a regular reason
No 25 point lead is ever safe in Atlanta.
Hawks fun to watch and man weird seeing rondo there but you can tell the difference he will make at least in the locker room
Glad for the win but I had ATL at -9.
Trae Young is going to be a legit OPOY or MVP candidate.
Eventually Josh Jackson will get some help
Lmfao this is a good night
[deleted]
ECF preview?
2020 is now 2015
You'll have to go through Orlando first
There can be only one
Today was the best game by far considering everything

It makes me think we need to move d Rose quickly and Blake if we can for anything at all

If we can’t move Blake I think he needs to lessen his role and let the young guys start to take over

I loved this game
Grant legitimately looks like a solid option, glad to see him playing well after betting on himself
Is sekou not good? I was looking forward to him breaking out, but it's his second year and he's still coming off the bench with few minutes and not putting up impressive numbers.
Those two really impressed in the season opener too. Grant looks like he’s just gonna keep on rolling from the bubble.
Just now learned Josh Jackson is with the Pistons...I hope he can shine and learned from all the dumb shut in his past.
OKC should take notes...
Jerami Grant is a freak.
Noted sharp shooter Rajon Rondo
Big If True
what happened? i didn’t watch please don’t tell me my boys trash now
We would never have even led lol
The time 2 years ago on the radio the guy says "and tonight the Hawks lose to the clippers. I mean, tonight the Hawks _play_ the clippers".

Talk about muscle memory.
Defense was lack luster fo sho
Are we already so used to winning that we think there is such a thing as a bad win? Cuz there was no such thing as a bad win last season.
Now that idiot who was talking about how Trae has led y'all to more 10 game losing streaks than 3 game winning streaks can shut up
March 21st to March 26th, 2019. Traes rookie season
I feel that. This is the second 3 game win streak since LeBron left for the Cavs.
Only really won because of Detroit's awful defense
Isaiah Stewart is not fun to play against
great game! super impressed by the grit on the pistons sans griffin and rose. really good stuff
Gg to you guys man. Absolutely love jerami and your rooks are incredibly impressive. 

Also I’m legit scared of isiah lol guy is an animal.
Yall got a Stud in Hayes. Congrats
yall honestly pretty solid, JJ actually looked nice and Grant as well. Missing BG and Rose too
You guys really held your own, gg
Tonight wasn't our normal play by play, it's usually Blaha. He's a lot more biased, Kane was pretty good imo
Rondo is a godsend
Bogi 17 points 5 assists on elite shooting, taking no prisoners last night
I’m excited for Hayes. I think he will get better as the year goes on
no disrespect to trae but he needs to try on defense
That was actually insane
I need a clip of it... So badly
what happened?
dudes got more IQ than luka
I too am having strange feelings about cheering for Rondo, but if this is what wrong feels like I don’t want to be right.
That’s exactly how I felt last year lol
I didn't think I liked Goodwin at backup point, but now I KNOW I don't like him there thanks to Rondo.
Yeah it fucking sucks, no shortage of people who want to post get that sweet post game karma. I can't remember if it was a rule before, but including the box score should be required
The generator is down and hasn't been fixed yet. The guy who runs it is working on it though.
it really is, imagine having Rondo, Bogi, and Gallo off your bench lol.
I have a hard time figuring out who is worse than us . A top 5 pick seems almost inevitable
That's what we're gunning for. Hopefully top 3 pick lol.
agreed
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
ehhh can he bring his lunch pail to work everyday tho??
Now the argument against him is that too many of his points come from free throws, and that he flops and complains and draws contact too much. Cheap or not, that's just part of the game, and the opposing team is giving them to him more than any other player this year so far. People will always try to tear down scorers like that.
It's gonna be his 1st 88 game win streak of his career if we're being honest.
Someone get this man a gold
[deleted]
That's what the Rondo does. 5 star General
He’s been forced to play center with Capela being out/having a minute restriction tonight. That’s not good for him defensively, as he is severely undersized there
I think it’s mostly just foul issues and being asked to play too many minutes at the 5 where he doesn’t work. I expect it to get better once Capela can go more than 20 and OO is back
*Jordan looking at iPad meme
If I were to be completely honest, I want to play the bulls another 69 times before the playoffs.
What else can it be?
2015 rematch is gonna be spicy
You gotta let us win a game this time
I wish
Playoffs like it's 2009
Jeremi Grant TANK COMMANDER
Dealing w rolled ankle. That said I think he’s rly improved but for some reason we never run plays through him even before.
He still has the brightest potential on the team, but he's currently the 3rd best PF on the team right now. Grant has slid down to the SF to start along Blake, so Sekou will be the backup PF to either Blake or Grant. 

As seen in this game, the whole roster works better if Blake isn't in the rotation. We play faster without him and the defense looks quicker and more athletic with Grant at PF.
He's been okay, but he's dealing with a bad ankle he twisted last game right now.
Famed 3pt marksman Solomon Hil
Big if Trae
First time since he's been traded here that he started for us
No dude hes been excellent for us in preseason. He was on a minutes restriction and we sorely missed him in the fourth.
Solid defensive presence and rebounder, and grabbed some points on pick and roll.  He is exactly what we need our starting center to be.  I was really happy to see him out there.
Last year if we went down 5-0 in the first minute of the first quarter it would’ve been game over.
Lack luster is I putting it nicely
The defensive rebounding could, uh, use a little work... But I already love this team 😁
Capela looked good at least, having rim protection is a beautiful thing. Though we're gonna get torched by better teams in the PnR unless Nathan Knight emerges as some hyper versatile defender
Expectations out of control after we handled the Bulls (solid argument for worst team in the league) lol... let's see how we hang with the Nets Wednesday, because that game is a preview of the EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS LETS GO BABY!!!!!!!!!!
counterpoint, it was only close because of our awful defense
We went up 24 points in the 4th and relaxed.
He’s a beast and will get so much better
Him Bey and Hayes got me vibin
He hasn't shown it yet in the NBA, but in college he had a decent face up game even extending out to 3 a few times. He plays a bit hyper, but he's skilled too.
new Deandre Jordan
Yea i think Hayes has a lot to learn but i could see him becoming really good in the future
They are trying Kane out and he has been fantastic from what I’ve seen. Hopefully he gets to run play-by-play full time
BAH GAWD THATS GOTTA BE KANE
Yeah he had a rough shooting 2nd game but a solid first game with 15/7/2 and shot 3/8 from 3.  He helped impact the game in other ways 2nd game with 9 boards.

last night was easily his best with 17/5/5 and 5/7 from 3. Just a great piece to start alongside Trae or be a 6th man.
Absolutely. PG is such a hard position to adapt to the league in as a rookie. We went through it with Trae, Hayes will figure things out super fast and he already shows great flashes of being the smart player people projected him as. Just doesn't have the extreme explosiveness or athleticism some rookie PGs can fall back on, but like I said with Trae we've seen that's not the end of the world
His effort was really good the first two games, much improved on last year. Today it wasn't just him, defensive effort was pretty awful from almost everyone. It's why the Pistons got so many second looks, straight up outhustled us
He wasn't bad tonight, granted the Pistons have a bad backcourt but they were held very much in check.  Detroit stayed in it by crashing the glass hard and getting a ton of offensive rebounds, which is not at all on Trae.

Hawks up 5 with 35 seconds left, Pistons take a shot, miss it, rebound fumbles around and trae grabs it but is falling out of bounds with nobody in sight to pass it to, looks to the ref and calls TO while slowly falling out of bounds with the ball in his hands lol
trae rebounded a ball and was falling out of bounds with like 30 seconds left and called a timeout to the official right as he fell out
I know it'll never happen but I hope one day we'll stop making this about Luka vs Trae and just appreciate that they're both amazing in different ways but will always live in the shadow of Nathan Knight.
I know other posters might have their own opinions and views about trae in the clinch, but over the past few years after watching him with the ball in the late fourth and in OT he has impressed me time and time again. Next time the hawks are in a competitive late game battle, watch Trae. I promise this man can deliver when it matters most (watch his highlight reel on YT for a few examples)
trae may have a higher bbiq, but luka is for sure scrappiest, more determined, a harder worker, and more cerebral
He is Luka in a 6'1 body.
a brick has a higher crunch time bbiq than luka
The box score generator is down.
Dunn and Snell as the 11th and 12th man is very nice lol
Don't forget Red Velvet, Okongwu, Hill, and Dunn. People are clowning on Solomon Hill but he's the kind of vet that comes in with Rondo and absolutely clowns other teams' rookies and second units.
I mean Bogdan played 30 minutes, he maybe didn't start the game but I wouldn't call him a bench player
Like even if you guys don’t get the number 1 pick you could get Suggs or Mobley or Green or Kuminga or someone and those are such great players to build around
The Bulls and the Knicks are really the only ones that can finish below you imo
I think thats the joke.
Leave us alone mannnn
After the 69th time, the Hawks will be ready for SexLand
We want a redo now that the bad man is gone
Bad news for us, then. Cavs and Magic abused us in 2009 and 2010.
Yea from what i've seen he looks like lesser role rather than working on incorporating him in the system with Hayes. 

Way too early to tell, but just wish pistons focused more on him. Don't know why but I have a feeling he'll be really good one day lol.
Yeah, Blake looks very awkward with this team.
Actual 6th man of the year candidate Kevin Huerter
Both Pels legends
Small is Trae.
oh that’s what he meant i thought he was making a “well that was a basketball game” type sarcastic remarks i knew he had been out
good to hear rooting for capela and you guys
great to hear, capela is really good and I think people forget how good he can be.
It’ll be somewhat better as Capela comes off his minutes restrictions and the rotations solidify.  I think the Capela-Collins combo is going to need more work than most were giving it credit for, but I’ve said for a bit that with those 2 and Trae Young the opportunity for a triple option type of PnR system is there
I’m glad you have realistic expectations friend.
I seriously think you guys can make the playoffs. You've had great drafts and have made some decent signings this year to fill up the holes. You're in as great of a position as a team with a lot of young guys can hope for.
You were still on pace for a lot of points the entire game.
They should. You guys are low key one of the most athletic teams in the league.
I'd take a new Ben Wallace.
Future 1st Team All-NBA?
Once Blaha is done he probably will. And agreed, I really enjoyed the broadcast tonight. Although I don't mind the homerism, a more neutral perspective is nice
Yea you’re 100% right. Trae young looks like the future best pg in the nba in like a year or 2(he has a case this year too).
Piston fan here. Really disappointed in his lack of speed and explosiveness. You can really see a difference between Hayes on the one hand and Morant and Young on the other. They’re so much more athletic! Hopefully, Hayes at least turns into a Jalen Rose type. I don’t think he’ll ever be a Young or Morant type. Not built for it.
No excuse he needs to try and contest shots
thanks
And afterwards pointing\tapping to his brain\mind, with a smug grin
Just a real bring his lunch pail to work type of guy huh? Always first in the gym last one out
The kinda guy you’d let date your daughter
Also well rounded
You left out “white” lol
If trae has more BBIQ how is luka more cerebral on the court? Aren't those essentially synonymous in this context?
who can shoot
If Trae was Lukas height he’d be waaaayy better than Luka
Awful takes.
Somebody get the box score gasoline
damn why do they still suck?? they both have players that should be dominating for them now.
OKC
Hey, y’all had your 3 and a half quarters of glory against golden state.
Really it all starts and ends with Trae, if Trae can be just slightly more than a folding chair on defense, then we should be a lot better
Don't come to our sub then, it's all self deprecating delusional rapture
Playoffs?? lol this is looking like a 16-0 playoff season for us. Ez
Damn I know it's coming but it's gonna be rough when Blaha steps down. He's a hall of famer to me but I don't know how he's viewed outside the Detroit area.
I've always thought of Kane as super homer and Blaha/Kelser quite neutral
When did I make excuses for him? He was really bad on defense tonight. Everybody on our team bar maybe Reddish and Fernando was really bad on defense. They all need to improve.
Runs routes real well
The belly is where he keeps all his Luka magic
just saying, there’s certain physical qualities luka has that enhance his intangibles to a level someone like trae can’t reach
this is probably True.
I personally think Luka is amazing but his decision making at times is bad and he has said hes going to work on it. Its one of the reasons i have Trae over Luka right now also hes a better shooter atm.
Luka is the CEO of bricking stepback three's with 22 seconds left on the shot clock in close games. Absolutely atrocious clutch stats and performances all through last year.
Well you see it's the Knicks.

Bulls idk.  Like they have some solid pieces in Lauri and Lavine.  White looks to be decent but still has a ways to go.  WCJ idk man he looked bad against us to start this year.  They should be better than they have been to start this year
Hey I actually watched y’all boys tonight and was really shocked at how well y’all have come together so fast.  It was against the pistons but I think a cavs hawks ECF is a lock.
In his normal role Kane does seem a bit of a homer, but when he does play by play he seemed pretty honest and relatively unbiased. IMO Kelser is super biased as well, not necessarily a bad thing though
I heard he performs circumcisions in third world countries.
probably Trae
Trae is not better than Luka, and I think all of the league would agree with me
You know where you're at right?  We only jerk to volume stats on this sub, especially when you talk about the golden boy
Lemme guess how many tiddies you get dm'd

👌
we good over here lol
The only thing Trae doesn't have on Luka is defence and tbh, the only reason Luka is a better defender is because he can just throw his 240 body right in front of a defender lol. Trae is 6'1 190 at best, hes going flying if he tries that. The funny thing is, they are both below average defenders.
Even if he never is the comparison should be the value of Trae and Cam compared to Luka since that was the compensation for trading down to five.  With Reddish now healthier than he's been since high school we're starting to see the player everyone was waiting to see but didn't at Duke and the first half of his rookie year.  This combo makes the trade pretty close in my mind...Luka's phenomenal talent not withstanding.

However I propose instead of debating their respective merits we simply have them hash it out every June for the rest of the 20's.  I seem to recall a certain point guard and small forward with a bit of a rivalry in the  80's.  That idea sounds fun if you all are up for it.
If you go to the right subs you’d be surprised.
dont you dare short Luka of his precious uncontested DREB!!!!!!!! you cant forget those!!!!
Forget the 80’s, I want it to be like Curry v LeBron again.
Cavs go 2-0 for the first time since 2017
[deleted]
seems like the cavs philosophy tonight was to run the offense through the center and when it doesn't work, try it again. and again. and again.

including shots they were fouled, Drummond and Javale had *37* looks. that's not okay.

infuriating to watch, especially with Sexton/Osman/Garland all being efficient all game long. Thank god they let Sexton/Garland take over in 2OT
Since it's clear now that we're on an unstoppable pace to a 72-0 season, it's time to discuss, which one of our players is getting the MVP trophy?
Collin Sexton's weakness is being a SG in a PG's body.

But who gives a fuck about that when man can drop 32 on 65% shooting lmfao that man can score
Cavs and Hawks running the east, as we expected.
[deleted]
If you don’t like whatever the fuck that was, you don’t like NBA basketball.
Young Bull can ball no doubt
Garland’s shot is so good. He always had amazing form was only a matter of time before it started dropping.
Drummond is the reason why we won and why we almost lost this game
Cavs undefeated since March.
SexLand best East backcourt duo? 👀
Andre Drummond thinks he's a stronger Karl-Anthony Towns. 

He's actually a Dwight Howard/JaVale McGee that doesn't know his role.

SexLand rules. That game was a beautiful mess.
5 players with 15 or more points for the cavs 🔥🔥🔥 good team ball fellas
I hope the Cavs fuck around and take the 8th seed
Cavs the best team in the NBA you cannot deny this
Holy this Cavs team might sneak into the playoffs. 

Sexton is underrated. He might be the second best young guard in the east behind Trae.

Garland looks healthy and improved. He looked like a legit point guard this game unlike last year where he looked lost most of the time.

Okoro is much better than I thought (had an off game though)

And of course Love/Drummond is a solid veteran front court. They seem to embrace letting the young guys do their thing.

Not to mention their broadcast team is great

Too early to tell how good their bench is, but Exum, Nance, Cedi, and Javale is a good mix of offense, defense, and energy.
Cavs are sp00ky as fuck let’s gooooooo
Might be the best Cavs team without LeBron since he was drafted. Not saying much but they're young and fast and exciting for once
[deleted]
That was a hell of a comeback in OT, thought it was over
SexLand. Coming to an empty arena near you.

That said, I require more LNJ in our starting lineup. The ball movement is so much better with him in.
Watching Drummond put the ball on the floor makes me sad
Sexton is good.
I know we don't usually get lowlight vids of Dec 26 Pistons-Cavs games, but my god Rose's almost singlehanded immolation of the Pistons in 1st OT might be the biggest one-player choke I've *ever* seen
25-7 run to end the first OT/finish the second. Incredible poise down the stretch from the whole team
[Anthony Bennett](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bennett_(basketball\)) yelled out at his TV, “There you go! There you go.” Sharpshooter [Dion Waiters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_Waiters) gave a look of pleasant surprise from his G league team. Guard [Christian Eyenga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eyenga) yelled out from the Korean Basketball League, “We got an [expletive] squad now.” And before Isaac Okoro hit the locker room door, former Cavs NBA draft bust [Dajuan Wagner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dajuan_Wagner) hugged him and said, “You'll make it 4 seasons.”
I’m a fan if a decent basketball team. I’ll be damned.
The Nets don’t want this smoke
>checks schedule 

*Nervous Sweating*
2 major Ls for Detroit today
I'm ready to purchase my season's passes to SexLand
East runs through Cleveland
Sexland, Okoro, Cedi playing great, KPJ to come back.

We’re going to be fun as fuck when we stop running Drummond post ups every 3rd possession.
I watched this game cause I have Sexton and Garland on my fantasy team and I was not disappointed. These kids can hoop.

But man for someone who puts up gaudy stats, Andre Drummond plays like shit.
Garland looks so much better
Love all of our young guys. Somehow I like Javale the most out of all the vets on the team - Love and Drummond have been rough, at least in the small sample size of the few games last year + tonight. 

GG Pistons
Cavs went on a 23 - 7 run starting in OT. Pistons really broke down
uhh ohhh the Cavs are playing playoff basketballll
SexLand is real
watching Blake Griffin is hilarious. I give him credit, he's not really bitching or complaining but you could just tell in that 2OT that he wanted no part of being in DET lol
Sexton might fuck around and get voted to the All-Star team at this rate
2 in a row baby! Tomorrow we get to see what this team is made of against actual good talent though. Even if it’s a back 2 back.
Ah fuck we lost to the cavs
So

SexLand might be for real huh
Sexland being quietly impressive.
2020 Cavs or 1996 Bulls?
Free Blake Griffin. Detroit is basketball purgatory lol
My family turned off this game part way through the second OT, we couldn’t handle it anymore. Simply terrible basketball out of Detroit
Owning Sexland in fantasy has never felt better.
Anyone got a clip of that Javale coast to coast?
The SexLand
Cavaliers 72-0 season inbound
We're going to be bad but instead of a bad rebuilding team, we're a bad team that filled up our cap and still plays vets 33+ mpg.
Send my man Rose to Pelicans.
Fun game
If you didn't watch the game it's probably gonna be hard for you to imagine how absolute dogshit the Pistons played to close this one out. That was embarrassing. They hoisted so many terrible threes at the end of regulation, then jumped out to a lead in OT only to completely collapse.
okoro with just 3 rebounds in 42 minutes and nothing else

he’s looked solid so far and obviously this is a welcome to the nba moment for him but still a funny stat line

edit: and one steal mb
Pistons team sucks really bad. Only Griffin and Rose are half decent.

On Pistons sub some fools will be happy, because they believe tank works. LOL

Just cancel this franchise. LMAO
Casey’s rotations are frustrating. Pistons badly need to trade Blake and rose so that we can get some younger guys to play more
I have Drummond and sexton in my fantasy and the game doesn’t even count :(
What team is Killian going to when the Pistons get Cade
Blake "8-16 from 3" Griffin
The Cleveland Cavaliers have a better record than the Los Angeles Lakers. Just wanted you to know this.
SEXLAND! THIS IS FOR YOUUUU!!!!
Looks like Grant played better this game. That's nice to see.
Cedi for 6MOY
And we're missing arguably our most promising player in KPJ
I just wanna say I won a 5-team parlay off this game, so thank you Cleveland!
God our fucking team is ran by morons. Still trying to win when you're trash, barely playing rookies, and you still fucking lose anyways. Oh yeah, Casey won't just let rookies make mistakes, but he'll let Blake and Rose iso all game long and not try to change anything at all. We ain't winning shit. Stop trying to be competitive you morons
This game was bad for basketball
Isaac Okoro 41 Minutes 0 Points
This is one of the worst games I've watched this season, and I've watched one and a half games.
Man 42 minutes and 0 points???? 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
something something **THE EAST RUNS THROUGH CLEVELAND** something
Uh ohh, the Cavs are playing playoff basketballlll
Cavs vs Celtics ECF confirmed!
finals incoming??
First time since 2000 with no LBJ
Cavs with Sexland are 2-0

Wizards with Westbrook and Beal 0-2

Really makes you think
I’m a huge Sexton homer and been singing his praise for years now. I think he will be a 24 ppg scorer on 58-60% TS. But he won’t make an all star game this year and I don’t think he will next year. Trae Young will have gaudier stats, Ben Simmons is on a contender,  Beal is a scoring monster, WB has huge name recognition, Middleton and Jrue are on a contender, jimmy butler took the heat to the finals, and then you still have Lowry/siakam/FVV/OG from the raptors and Tatum/Smart/Brown. Cavs need to be much much better or Sexton needs to make a huge jump. Maybe if he makes a huge defensive leap- which he’s improved at but just dies on screens and still gets lost off ball. But idk. He’s underrated but I don’t think an all star game is that close for him. I’d just be happy to hear Zach Lowe mention his name in a positive light.
LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK.
i’m so ready for it
Hnnng
people now underrate players who don't shoot a lot of 3s but there are certain guys that can score in a lot of ways and Sexton is looking like he has figured out the game
Cedi, Sexton, and Garland were all shooting 75%+ from the field with multiple 3’s and Love’s throwing entry passes into a center shooting 5/17 from the field in crunch time. Idk if that was a JBB directive, or Love was just showing love to his veteran frontcourt mate, but I was yelling at my TV.
the amount of entry passes Love made was hilarious... no matter how many times Drummond let someone smack the ball out of his hands and out of bounds.
On the one hand im very happy about the chemistry between garland and sexton. On the other hand I hate the chemistry between love and Drummond. I think bickerstaff is a very bad coach, which was confirmed with those I be liable trash ATO plays. Holy shit they were embarrassing to watch.
SexLand. Dual MVP.
Cedi
Whoever stops passing to Drummond
DWade wants another MVP
JaVaaaaale McGeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
See you in the finals bb
I was told he doesn't know how to play basketball 🤗
He could be a stapler in Rob Schneider's body. If he's dropping 30 a game on good efficiency who cares? Like yes he'll be a bit of a defensive liability but honestly he's not the worst on ball defender. He's just a little lost. Just as mental as it is physical right now so hopefully he can get that fixed up and become just regular bad instead of like historically bad.
He’s actually been a pretty decent PG in his lineups where he was ran at the 1 for a while now. Aside from the 3rd quarter stretch where he had his worst stretch of decision making since 2019, as well as a bunch of missed opportunities both off bad passes and a ton of wide open gifts to his teammates 3 assists really doesn’t show how well he was passing
Just give it to him on the fast break and get tf out the way
Drafting the worst defending undersized guards is the recipe for success it seems
Is it 2015?
This would be great
I'm dying lmfao
first ballot let's go lmaoo
Beautiful
Now we’re cookin with gas
Garland's shot is eye bleach for whatever the fuck Drummond does on offense
Shrodingers Drummond
[deleted]
sexton averaging like 29 points a game for most of 2020
BealBrook would like a word
he had like 4 steals and 3 blocks and hit all of his free throws down the stretch though
He's not even those guys, those guys can protect the rim Drummond can't

He should just rebound, catch lobs, putbacks and not try anything else, a dribble or a post up should be a 100000$ fine
After watching this game I became confused on how he didnt average a 5x5 in Detroit
He will likely average more turnovers a game than any other center, while averaging less assists than any of the guys near him on that list.  The guys who will be close in TOs are Jokic, Embiid, Towns, but they’ll all have more assists (Embiid just slightly)
[deleted]
Why are you hoping we'd regress and *drop* to the 8th seed huh 😤
We're on pace to go 72-0 and you're talking about the 8th seed lmfao
Facts I really enjoyed the Cavs broadcast team, I like their color commentator.
Love and Drummond didn’t really embrace the young guys until 2nd OT. Too much forcing Drummond which let the Pistons get back in the game in the first place.
Best game Garland has had, but he’s looked waaasy more confident this year, both ends of the court.
I’d love to see playoffs, but we’re still in rebuild mode. Perhaps if Cedi and Javale consistently produce off the bench like they did tonight my mind could be changed.
[deleted]
They beat the Pistons and Hornets. They're not making the playoffs lol
Calm down, it’s been 2 games
Second best behind Trae?😂
Definitely better than any Kyrie team.
Bought them right when OT started tbh
In the 4th, too.
And the pace of the team too. Nance allows for a quicker offense and he brings a lot more than Love as a defender
It’s weird because he’s usually real consistent. Everyone’s gotta have a bad game at some point
He has had some spectacularly unclutch late game performances for us
no DeSagana Diop reference. Half points.
The Dajuan Wagner story was kinda sad. Like he basically had a broken asshole and had to retire early. I don't think he was necessarily a bust.
Where is my Vitaly Potapenko?
Christian Eyenga... the first round pick literally no one ever talked about at any time
Don't worry, we'll dump the ball to Drummond a thousand times for some reason on offense and Embiid will son him on the other end.
Tbh us being bad this year is a good thing. This pistons team is the worst team in the nba
Trying to get some trade value for that man and not doing very well
He was clutch though and played good defense. But yes he forces too much
idk man he loves it here, he’s said it constantly, he wants to stay as a mentor and help the young guys develop


Blake is genuinely one of the nicest guys in the NBA, I was surprised at how goddamn likeable he is hahaha
He’ll miss the post-All-Star snub buff though. Dude can average 30 ppg if he gets snubbed again.
We have Delly to lock up mj so I gotta take the cavs on this one.
They're killing their own trade value.
Drummond for Griffin, who says no!?
Need to play Killian as much as possible.
+16 though which doesn’t mean much in one game but at least it’s clear he wasn’t getting in the way on offense and was giving us solid defense.
Tank only works and you firesale your entire roster, play the you g ones as focal points, and treat vets as nothing more than vets. In the Pistons case, they traded their young pieces and are playing through the vets. Makes no sense what direction they’re going
If you are looking for a salary dump, may I (re)interest you in one slightly-used (1) Andre Drummond?
Damn, 44 minutes for Griffin in game 2 of the season against the Cavs.  Let 'er rip, Casey!  Too bad he was 1-5 inside the arc, didn't draw any shooting fouls and was -16, but I hope he can make a healthy comeback for the full season.
Actually crazy with how hot he started that he still ended at 50%
He also had a +16 and played incredible defense. Did you watch the game?
there you go! there you go!
Just took TT leaving to make it a reality lol
all in
You forgot the '' still '' bro !
3-0
Did the Nets try to fly around the world and fall off the edge
https://streamable.com/dg7yk
The wiz need bertans playing more minutes. That dude erased the sixers lead in like 2 minutes.
So Sexton is basically Eastern Conference Devin Booker? He'll probably get in a year too late as an injury replacement.
If the cavs keep winning and he keeps his efficiency and scoring output while doing a bit of playmaking I think it's going to be really tough to keep him out of the all-star game. Especially in the east.

Lotta "if"s but still, it's not crazy to think about.
there was a play where they literally just had Garland go up to the right elbow/right baseline and pass it to Drummond in the middle... like come on guys
The directive is to get Drummond as many looks as possible to raise his trade value. Not saying I want to trade him just for the hell of it though, especially if we're looking like a playoff team somehow at the deadline. He seems to really like being in Cleveland and that's a rarity so I would totally bring him back next year but just not at anything close to what he's making. Like maybe cut that on half as a starting point.
Were they trying to get Plumlee to foul out?
they're trying to get trade value i would guess
there's been a dual ROY, there should be dual MVPs too
Cedi must win a 6MOY
Man he had a fucking awful game. But cut him some slack cause he made 4 free throws in crunch time, IN A ROW
I don’t want to hear it from the guy who forgot who was up in an NBA finals game
What do you know, you've been dead for 40 years.
You’ll rue the day you posted this when the young bull wins DPOY
You mean holy water?
No he’s on the Lakers
If he continues to put effort in on defense I totally agree. Frankly when he's engaged like he was for a good part of tonight he looks nice other than his frantic offense. The dude looks like he's about to have an anxiety attack every time he gets within 10 feet of the rim the way he rushes the ball up, it's real ugly.
Yeah he picking up right where he left off so this hot start isn't really all that surprising. Still can't play defense and still not much of a playmaker but if we're not asking him to be the main handler then that doesn't matter as much. 

If this is the player he's gonna be that's like 85% of Brad Beal for a fraction of the price for a few more years which is hype.
OC’s pretty clearly referring to his offensive role
Well he had 3 blocks and 4 steals tonight. I’d say that’s a good night defending
He might not be usually but he was an awesome rim protector tonight
We’ll actually be the first 0th seed that gets an automatic qualification for the finals after we go 72-0 and find a warp whistle
Austin Carr baybee. Huge homer but it’s fun to listen to him ramble.
Austin Carr’s commentary is like watching basketball with your grandpa
They're both great but damn do I miss Fred. One of the best.
Put some respect on Austin Carr’s name
cool you say this because i was actually just watching your game with OKC and i love how hyped your announcer got when Miles Bridges went off
that shit was infuriating. Dumping the ball to Drummond who sucked all night just for him to miss layups and free throws. wtf what were they thinking
Don’t forget, KPJ is going to come back at some point. I don’t think we’re making the playoffs, but we’re definitely looking a lot better!
There's not much young guard in the east tho. Melo? Fultz?

Ja, Jamal, Book, Donovan, Fox, SGA, Luka etc. are all in the West
Yeah, he’s easily better than Trae
That’s not unreasonable... not sure if you missed the qualifier of “young” but the other candidates are:

Coby White

Markelle

Herro

Lamelo

And some other smaller names
It's the East lmao those are the other teams in the running.
Who's better currently? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jawad "hot wad" Williams
Jeff Trepagnier rolling in his grave.
It’s sad that I’m happy about that
His trade value is probably going to come from his expiring contract, not his play
absolutely, im a fan of him, impressed by his energy and willingness to put the effort in. also really enjoying the hunger from the young guys on the cavs, hoping that you guys can keep the energy going and rack up some more wins this year.
😂 dude must be Andre Roberson 2.0 then. You want a pat on the back for that draft pick?
We got a fucking squad now!
*whispers* small sample size but we might actually play better without Kevin Love too
you predicted it
No nets and bucks got promoted to the Western Conference like it’s European soccer.
Analytics guy in the Wirzards locker room: Russell please stop chuking 3s you suck at it.

Westbrook:
He's out of shape and on a "minutes restriction" they said
I'll take Eastern Conference Devin Booker.
Yea none of this is gonna happen, we beat Detroit and Charlotte.  I still think Collin will continue to improve though!
So frustrating! I’m all for feeding the big man, but not when he’s shooting 30% from 5 feet away
I do not think we should trade Drummond right now, he's our only really solid big man who can defend the paint and rebound like a monster.
Lots of dual things in SexLand
Nah I'm just memeing for the easy points. He came up huge in critical moments for us.
Think he meant garland lol
Nah Andre’s best offense has an always will be off the glass or in the PnR. Let your guards set him up with positioning to where he can get a tip or a putback. His post game is laughable and he can’t shoot. If you start forcing him, you’re only hurting him and yourself once he gets in his own head.
Maybe he's trying to make up on the other end for being a giraffe on ice on offense
I thought I was done with awful post ups since TT left.
Yes i know im just saying those guys can protect the rim at least
Those don't mean good defense, he was good towards the end but he is a mess at the rim

If he was a good rim protector it would make him such a valuable player
Two of those blocks were him blasting Sekou in the face, and two of those steals were D Rose losing the ball without Dre even touching it
I don't get to listen a lot but when I do they seem to put over the other team a lot more than most broadcasters
He's such an OG who has such love for the team that it's infectious. He seems genuinely hurt when they fuck up. I still miss Fred, but will always be glad he got to call the championship.

Joe Tait is the fucking man and I miss him a lot, too. I used to deliver pizza in high school and college, and that man narrated  a significant amount of my nights. I'll always remember his last game and instead of signing off with his usual, "Have a good night, everybody!" he said, "Have a good life, everybody!" And I think about that a lot. So sweet, so to the point, so Joe Tait.
AC just gets super hype which is what you want out of your local color guy. I think he's pretty fair when it comes to calling the game though.
Fred was the GOAT and nobody can convince me otherwise

RIP 🙏🏼
https://twitter.com/SN_Ohio/status/1337108098989879296?s=09 please enjoy this short clip of Fred loving the cavs
Miss feee throws? They tied it up at the end cause the Pistons kept fouling him and he made all of em in crunch time
Herro maybe?
What exactly has Ball done to be put in this conversation
I mean simmons is only 24. Depends on what your definition of young is I guess. Also RJ Barrett exists but it depends if u classify him as a 2 or a 3.
Pistons are not in the running lol.
Lmao mans responded 26 days after😂
As of now that’s really all they’re asking him to be so? Should’ve had more shots if Drummond wasn’t an absolute black hole
y’all look so different
You mean you don't want Kevin Love out there bricking 3s and sulking and being a matador cape on defense??
As a Pels fan those words five me ptsd.
A man can dream.
Really hoping this game was an exception since Drummond was playing his former team
I don’t get it man, I don’t care so much how many boards he has on the year until he gets those turnovers down.  Averaging 4 turnovers per game as a big man is nuts!
Okoro is good enough for garland and himself it's ok
"frankly when he's engaged"
Lol, this will be cavs fans in every discussion about Drummond. I stan'd for Drummond for 7 years saying the same thing. I am officially passing my torch to you. Last night was actually Drummond at his worst. When he tries to be "the guy" and short rims 5 footers, turns the ball over trying to be a guard and is over aggressive defensively. His numbers will be gaudy but his play will be too.
he hit some big free throws late in this one, give him some credit
Yeah, especially with Fred they were very good about giving credit to other teams but also being extremely excited and passionate about the Cavs. Great duo for Cavs fans, just wish Fred was still here :(
I feel like all of our sports commentators are pretty okay about giving credit where credit is due, especially our baseball guys.
That’s actually a really great quote from Joe. His book “It’s Been a Real Ball” is a very good  read.
fr it’s harlan, gus johnson, and fred
For the first 40-some minutes of the game it was a guaranteed miss-one-make-one situation.
Oh right forgot about him
he was certainly born young
He’s young, that’s about it
His name is Ball.
While I do enjoy shitting on the Pistons for no particular reason, it's not like they're at a dearth of talent.

Jerami Grant - A high-quality starting forward

Delon Wright - Sneaaakkkyyy good for the Mavs last year and still benefiting from Rick Carlisle's guard wisdom

Mason Plumlee - Athletic and a decent passer, but also prone to defensive gaffes

Killian Hayes - Why am I starting over Derrick Rose I'm clearly very green

Derrick Rose - Why am I coming off the bench for Killian Hayes I'm very fast and skilled

Blake Griffin - 3 Pt Specialist and tall

That said, their bench do be ass
lmfao family 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“at one point Koby Altman was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned.
Sssshhhh people who aren’t paying attention still think he’s valuable
Starting a season 2-0 itself is kind of defying expectations and Garland has played GREAT basketball in these 2 games too.  There’s some good things going on here!
Eh idk if I’d say worst. He didn’t look like he completely gave up and just said “fuck it” yesterday like he did games 1 and 2 vs MIL 2018. I’m also a Pistons fan so I know how horrible he is with his matchup getting to his head and taking him out of the game super easily
I also enjoy listening to Mike Breen. Too bad he’s stuck with Walt Frazier.
lmfao did you really type out that starting lineup thinking that’s a playoff caliber team
Their bench is a lot of young guys that Casey refuses to play over the vets for some reason. They’ve actually shown a little bit in the short time they’ve gotten (Sekou was injured today) but for some reason Casey hates playing young guys over vets
Can't fucking believe that was a quote about a MEETING with KD
Honestly I just wanted to meme about Blake Griffin being a 3 Pt specialist lol
Fair. I don't honestly know a ton about your guys, but I believe ya. Hope they pan out for you in the long run ^_^
I’m a Cavs fan, just double as a Detroit sports fan bc I live between the two cities. Not the best combos of sports cities lol
Twice the teams, double the misery. Welcome to Toledo
Lmfaoooo yep that’s me
Anthony Edwards is the greatest basketball player of all time
That’s it, fellas. Might as well crown us right now.
How can you not root for Towns after what he went through these past 9 months 

22/11/7 and a comeback dub ... Lets goooo
pistons got stuck at 101 and glitched out lmao
22-6 run by the T-Wolves to end it
Edwards is going to be a starter by the end of the season and I am all for it.
We missed so many layups lol
[deleted]
Not the prettiest win but great signs from Culver, Edwards and Beasley. Probably going to get killed in our next few games but a nice way to start.
No team really needs the lead anymore than 3 minutes to win a game.
Stat sheet doesn't show it — but man this team is better with Rubio on it.
Is this what it feels like to like 9 players on your roster? Gonna be a fun year
1st place in the west!
KAT, D-Lo, and Beasley were all very good, though D-Lo was a bit too trigger-happy at times. Jarrett Culver seems ready to make a pretty significant second-year jump. I was also very impressed with Edwards. He was so smooth out there.
Huh turns out I like when my team wins games. Who knew?
this is how it feels to be on top of the standings
The Wolves went from missing every 3 to making every 3. It’s funny how that seems to swing the outcome of a game.
That's the kind of game that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I'm glad we lost but we were really not trying to lose or be bad.  It's why I said take the over on our record. Casey is going to play the vets 30+ mpg and the young kids 10-20 minutes (no action for Bey tonight), and in the end we'll be bad but not bottom 3 bad.

We really did control most of the game, until KAT just feasted on Plumlee at the end.
ALL HAIL SIR ANTHONY EDWARDS
Wolves switching to zone on defense was a difference maker. KAT taking over at the end on offense between his passing and scoring, great from him.
I never want to watch this game again.
Great playmaking by Towns down the stretch, looking forward to see how far he can bring this team with this improved skill

Also, Jerami grant is so overpaid, really don’t understand what the pistons trying to do with him. Do they think they can build around him? If so, should we question the sanity of detroit leadership?

Free DRose

Anyone else so down bad they watched the whole 4Q despite not being a fan of either team?
Undefeated until today. Tough loss, but it was a good run boys
I never seen a team win after missing that many easy layups. But seriously though, our young guys (Edwards, Okogie, Culver) looked great, and the 4 guard lineups we were throwing out were surprisingly effective.
Pistons led this whole game but then remembered they were in tank mode.
Wolves might have won by 20 if they could make layups
The NBA isn't ready for us. [The future is now.](https://i.redd.it/3wxogo1802761.jpg)
Awoooooooo
Rose played well but Wolves win still. Perfect result. 4th quarter was so fun to watch.
The free throw disparity in this game was nuts

Pistons 3-8 from the line

Wolves 24/28
If the regular season ended tonight, the Timberwolves would be in the playoffs. This is a sacrifice I am willing to make.
Rooting hard for the Wolves to make the playoffs, gotta root for KAT after all he’s gone through and D’lo is one of my favorite players from his Brooklyn tenure. The west is brutal but I think they’ll be in the mix and fall in that 7-10 range and make the play-in tourney
Why in the F is towns only shooting 10 times.
http://imgur.com/a/Xbfl9Df
My God it is good to have the Wolves back and KAT with the casual 22/11/7.

On a more serious note, is that going to be our closing lineup going forward?
DLO's release is fucking quick
Man I feel like Blake has checked out of his career. He was barely trying on defense near the end - no that he was ever that good on defense to begin with. Definitely was one of my favorite players to watch in his prime.
KAT the Kloser
Well, the tank is looking good. How are the young prospects looking?
how do Twolves fans feel about Culver and Okogie and their potential progression going forward?
Bow down everybody, it's Timberwolves Time
Why is D’Lo coming off the bench?
At one point in a scrimmage, sources said, Edwards turned to GM Scott Layden and screamed, "You (bleeping) need me. You can't win without me." Edwards left teammates and coaches largely speechless. He dominated the gym in every way.
no more juancho, society has progressed pass his need.
How did Rose look?
Good looks for the Wolves, which sucks for us, but tbh the Pistons might be the worst team in the league. That roster is bizarre
I love Ricky and I love having him back, but *holy fuck* I had repressed how many layups he misses.

Great play in the clutch by KAT. Took abuse from Dolph Plumgren and didn't panic or force up bad shots, just found the open shooters who took care of the rest. Edwards showed some promise and Beasley while streaky came up with the goods when he needed to.
Box score?
D'Lo came off the bench? Wtf?
Blake is moving like a 60 year old man now
Pleasantly surprised with Edwards.

&#x200B;

22% from three though...
DLo is so frustrating to watch sometimes ... his shot selection looks like all of us throwing up terrible shots in our driveway. 

In the end he hit a big 3 and helped us win with that run at the end but man ...
Did Mason Plumlee ball out lol
I have no idea what the pistons are doing. Are they tanking? They look too good to be tanking
How binary
Lions suck, Redwings are rebuilding, Tigers are rebuilding and the Pistons lose on opening night. Is it too much to ask for ONE good team? 😭
Like half the Nuggets bench from last year was in this game. I heard that Malik looked ok, which is great. How about Plumdog and Grant?
DLo doesn't start?
The Pistons may very well be the worst team in the league this year.

Letting Woods and Leonard go... gonna be a mistake.

Fawk!

This is depressing. 

A 12-year rebuild with NOTHING to show for it. Haven't won a single game in the playoffs in over a decade.
Does D'lo not start for the wolves?
Another wasted year in D Roses career
Wow did he look awesome today. So happy. The way he is attacking the rim and getting to the line like that in his first game is a GREAT sign.
Lol they'd go on a big run and then literally as soon as Ant-man was put in we'd get right back even with them...

I don't wanna jinx anything but uhhhh I'm hype
Weird way to spell Jarrett Culvers name.
The guy from *ER* and *Top Gun*?
Thats RJ Barrett
Wolves vs Cavs finals when?
72-0 here we come!
He’s taking the game ball home to give to his father to put next to his mother. 

It would have been a damn travesty if we’d lost this one.
Couldve got more assists too if we weren’t missing open looks the team is just shaking off the rust and getting accustomed to eachother. Man Im excited for this season
Scored/assisted on I wanna say like 13 or 15 points in a row to close out the game. He's so good. Also 22 points on 10 shots.
The 7 is the standout stat to me. He was straight up creating in the fourth
Cyberpiston 2077.
If we didn't miss literally 10 point blank layups it wouldn't even be close.
Balanced out that ice cold stretch around 70 points.
We finally remembered that we’re tanking
He’ll be a starter before February at this rate.
4 guards and KAT starting lineup, really small ball.
By all-star break it looks like.
If Okogie can guard the opponent's 4 like he did tonight with Blake, you might as well start Ant over Layman.  Blake scored some of his power moves, but overall, Okogie played him well enough..  Throw in Culver and Rubio and you have a solid defense.
He should start in our next game. We need to find a way to get Layman/Juancho as little minutes as possible.
> We missed so many layups lol

It was like playing ball with the boys from work, goddamn !
Fucking Kirk Cousins can’t even made a layup. /s
no f that. this is sucks.
I looked at how we were playing and figured we'd win the first 4 games, then lose like 25 straight. This team is gonna play hard, and look ok, and lose a whole lot of games. I'm ok with that. Hope D Rose sticks around selfishly, just don't buy any jerseys, not because we're gonna get rid of everyone next year, our jerseys just suck and we need to teach the execs a lesson
We never pick above 7 so....
It didn't feel good. Feels bad man. 

Then again, ask Hawks, Grizzlies, Pelicans, and Mavs fans how they feel about Trae, Morant, Zion, and Luka.
Nah that sucks.  No reason to lose all those games to get the next Derrick Williams or Jonny Flynn.
Feels like u guys have too many swingmen?
The next 3 games are Jazz, Lakers, and Clippers. Rough start lol
At some point one of Edwards or Culver has to take his place in the closing line up but watching him order everyone into position for the last 2 minutes was a joy to watch.

Edit: So uhh, I thought I was replying to a Rubio post LMAO
Technically you could say the plus minus shows it
Him and D'Lo were a +19 when they played together
You could see him on defense calling out to Edwards  and some of the other young guys, telling them where to be. Made a big difference.
The advanced stat sheet will show it
Ehh 8. Layman and Juancho were both ooof tonight.
STOP THE COUNT.
DLo is always trigger happy, almost to a fault but I can’t really say shit because he makes a lot of his poor shot selections lol
[deleted]
Those of us who remember 2004 =(
Welcome to Moreyball!
I felt like it wouldnt have been close if we could make layups, but the game was fun.
Lol we will be bottom 3 bad. Our vets aren’t superstars it’s basically a bunch of bench players, Blake and rookies. It’s a bottom 3 roster
>the young kids 10-20 minutes 

 

19 year old Killian Hayes played 21 minutes

20 year old Sekou played 13 minutes

23 year old Josh Jackson played 29 minutes

23 year old Svi played 17 minutes
Have we played a single minute of zone the last 2 seasons? That was super different to see.
>Anyone else so down bad they watched the whole 4Q despite not being a fan of either team?

I was down bad until that 4th
>Great playmaking by Towns down the stretch

He was making some great passes all game. If we weren't bricking layups and wide open 3s through the first 30 minutes he could've easily had a triple double.
Free DRose lol he wants to be here gtfo. Now i would hope he can trade him for a 1st at the deadline, but we'll see.

Jerami Grant is a huge overpay yeah, was a weird signing that pissed me off at the time. But the silver lining is, he's still a great 3 and D guy that every contender would love coming off the bench. So ideally we can flip him for a 1st or some young assets at the deadline next year or the year after.
Every time we almost took the lead, we forgot how to play basketball.
Can’t get free throws if the other team doesn’t play defense. ::points to head::
Foul trouble early and lots of double teams
For the same reason he picked up 7 dimes, double teams.
They had him in the entire 3rd quarter and he posted up almost every possession. Dude was tired I’m sure.
Blake took 2 charges on KAT. You don't do that at his age if you don't care.

My read was that he was a little winded. Understandable given how long it has been since he played.
in 2019 he played in the playoffs on a torn meniscus 

I don’t think he’s checked out
Much higher on Culver than Okogie
I think we've seen most of what Okogie can be. A solid defensive player off the bench but an offensive liability. I'm very excited for Culver this season he already looks much better
Culver is sick as fuck. Okogie is okay, but his D was on show tonight. Culver has a great chance to live up to his draft slot.
Something to do with delayed COVID protocols for him just for tonight.
He looked the best out there aside from Russell and the cheating guy
> tbh the Pistons might be the worst team in the league.

Fingers crossed!!!
At least he didn’t do the dribble all the way under the basket and back out move
He had that sweet layup that Rose flopped on though!
Delayed Covid test and couldn’t warm up before the game
He's shooting better than curry from 3 currently
He shot better in the preseason and was a big part of keeping us in the game so not overly worried.
His shooting is something that wasn’t a huge highlight coming in, but isn’t terrible either. He will be a streaky shooter, but at this moment he adds slashing ability, okay playmaking, good rebounding, and good D.
I mean he was a huge reason we won that game.
Nah that's just D-russ

hard shot taker&maker
Yes
He does, there was a weird situation tonight i guess where they were awaiting late results of Dlo's covid test or something?
The rebuild began a month ago
COVID protocols delayed his arrival to shot around, so they had to go with Rubio for tonight.
The anti-wiggins
His ability to draw fouls is showing already
He still looks completely lost out there at times, but he’s def putting in the effort which is great to see

Once he can play without having to think about what to do/where to be he’ll be fine
He was the best prospect in this draft by far imo
Anthony

Edwards
ANTHONY EDWARDS
Pog, Wiggins vs. Lebron!!!
I didnt even watch the game but i can already tell this team isnt losing a game this season
Holy shit yeah, so glad you won this. Poor dude
Towns had some saucy passes that would’ve been assists if the shots went down. I think we’re gonna see him take his game to a whole different level this year
Blake stuck in the t pose under the bucket wasnt the best d tbh
The good news is almost everyone played well except Rubio and HG, and Rubio and the entire team picked up the defense at the end!
I'd say the same thing if we didn't miss 50 3's, a lot of which by our best shooters.
He'll be a starter before January at this rate.

Layman was hot garbage tonight.
I know what you mean and you’re completely right but I just love the visual of coach being like “we’re running a small ball lineup now so KAT get your seven foot ass on the court”
I bet it happens by game 5-6
I didn’t think the Wolves defended anyone well enough tonight until they went to a zone. Okogie guarding real 4s who are able to do damage is not something to trust. When Blake wanted to beat him up, he did it. It’s not going to look good on the boards either.
Okogie got worked by Blake, he basically didn't miss a shot inside. And he's lucky Blake was 0-5 on 3's.
Where do you work, the crisco factory?
Lol big up for the jerseys part. Like what the fuck, how do professional designers get in a room each year and design the ugliest pos "motor city" jersey I've ever seen. There's like 3 iterations and they all suck ass! And what the fuck's with the basketball for a logo? You had an incredible thing going with the horsepower horse, repping some fire, and you said "you know what, what about a plain, symmetrical basketball? How classic."
We have swingmen and Towns
This team would legit be complete if we could trade Layman/Juancho for one real big body
We have less when you count the 6-4 josh okogie as a pf cause thats where he is gonna get alot of minutes.  Culver will too play some 4 i bet.  Its not ideal at all but its better the Hollywood Juancho and Layman.
Love to see it.
Such a great pairing. D'lo has one of the smoothest offensive games, it's so fun to watch.
Yep! Some people are gonna disregard his role on the team because of his stat line, but the team is just better with him.
but I still have love for JMac 😍
We need a defensive big.
I was 12 and thought KG was an entity that had always existed and would always exist
I can't remember what I ate for breakfast, so I sure as hell can't remember 16 years ago T_T
2004 was fucking dope you right.
*Rosasball
They're not bench players. The lineup that closed the game were replacement level starters + Blake (who played terribly) and Rose. Casey is coaching for his job and he's going to ride those players.

Beyond that, all the idiots on the Pistons subs were convinced contenders would be clamoring for Blake and Grant, and it'll likely turn out the contracts are terrible trade assets.
Drose looked good
Yep. Toss in DNPs for the other first round picks.
It runs deep in the Saunders bloodline
That first quarter made me rethink life
Ahhh okay thanks for the info. I was so confused.
Not saying he wasn’t, but that doesn’t mean his shot selection couldn’t improve.
He was late to COVID protocol and testing. Apparently the organization is taking it seriously and so he was removed from the starting lineup as punishment. 

Honestly, it was a blizzard and I get being late but come on man...your best friend on the team's mother died from this stuff. Might want to take it a bit more seriously.
I might have been reset a month ago, but it has been going on for twelve years. 

It started when Billups was traded for Iverson.
What will always be the strangest thing is that Wiggins did that early in his career. He seemed effected by the Butler saga in a way KAT never did.

Edwards has a HUGE advantage in that he is not going to be expected to be the guy while KAT is here, much less DLo and all the other high pedigree guys.
He does look like he’s still thinking out there, but he really does seem to be picking up the game quickly. We are seeing improvements being made game by game which has me very excited.
When Ricky tricked his dime in the first quarter I think, I was like ahh shit here we go again
Layman was really rough too
Jake Layman was absolute garbage out there.
The Pains from Spain
They need RHJ
Layman... the only positive thing I can say about his game tonight was he was somehow better than Juancho.
Or, and here me out here, we smoosh them together to create one.
I wonder what RHJ is doing rn 🤔🤔
Tank one last year ... for Mobley
TRUE
which one tho
The concept of Immortal KG is the only thing that's ever scared LeBron.
Speak for your damn self. 13 year old me remembers Chris Webber clanking that three to cement a Wolves game 7 victory.
I feel like some contender will still take Blake when they get desperate this season.
We literally played josh Jackson in the last 3 minutes he’s not a replacement level starter, same with plumlee. The only other replacement level starter on this team outside rose and Blake is Jerami grant. I’m sorry a team who’s three best players are Blake,jerami grant and rose aren’t any better than a bottom five team

Who in the East outside maybe the knicks would you put the pistons over? Hell minnesota might be the second worst team in the west and they beat us
Ur dumb if u don’t think Grant will be an asset in a few years when he’s on his expiring deal. Even if it’s just to salary match.

Until them let him be the tank commander for a year or 2
Yep, DNPs in the 1st game of the season. Hell, Lamelo Ball played 15 minutes in his 1st game. 

Bey & Stewart will see time, give it more than 1 game before you act as if Casey hates young players.
We were down 19-11 with 5 mins left in the first and KAT having scored everything outside of 2 points and I would have completely understood if he wanted a trade then and there. Thankfully the team’s come around but man I feel for the guy
>Yeah I was gonna say, Wiggins looked great for a while. He just quite literally never improved anything besides his 3 pt shot. He arguably got worse in many areas also

One of the saddest things the last year Wiggins was with us was a quote where he was talking about Josh Okogie's dunking and reminiscing about how he used to do that. He was 23ish when he said that!
Even given that, I hope that this is not another Wiggins. I hope Timberwolves can catch a break from such a kind of 1st pick (KAT's different though).
Yeah I was gonna say, Wiggins looked great for a while. He just quite literally never improved anything besides his 3 pt shot. He arguably got worse in many areas also
He got mind broke by Jimmy
You know whats funny is that everyone is giving him shit for being a football player, but it’s football players who are known for being coachable, watching film, and getting reps in so they can improve their game

This exact type of incremental growth should honestly be expected with his football background
Yep, between the 3 of them they were 1 -12 from the field and i want to say at least 3 wide open layups missed as well. And i mean wideeee open!
Juanchito was awful tonight.
Stack them and hide it with a really baggy uniform.
Smoosh is hands down one of the greatest words out there.
Can we do that with Beasley and Okogie?
I dunno, jaunchake hernanlayman would still have pretty sus defense
seriously like wtf why did he get waived
Minnesota gave away next years pick as part of the D'lo deal
Josh Jackson was not the reason we lost tonight. He was still playing because he was playing really well, like a real nba starter. When he's not playing well, it'll be Delon Wright. The Cavs and Bulls will be worse than us.

And we may very well be bottom 5. I expect we're the 25th worst team. We should be trying to be bottom 3 and it's clear Casey isn't going to try for that.
That's a terrible use of cap space. We would've been better off not signing him at all and leaving the space own to take on bad contracts for additional picks.

Expiring contracts are a dime a dozen. That's not how you get value when rebuilding.
It's his coaching history.
He seems extremely different to me
Who knows what happens on the court but Edwards is anti-Wiggins in personality. Edwards has a freedom in the way Wiggins is just stoicism personified. I don't think that is bad, and I will always root for Wiggy, but Edwards is a very different guy.
With Wiggins we had to force it so hard. Every damn possession was run through Wiggins... 

Edwards is getting his in the flow of the game. He just looks much more in control. Hopefully the efficiency comes with time.
In my experience getting knowledge in one area contribute a lot when you learn something else. You can be a LeBron, just dedicate your life to one thing only, but most people stuck in one thing develop a tunnel vision and they are easy to be taught something new.
Rubio is in midseason form.
And preseason
They'd explode from possessing too much energy.
Actually his name would be jakecho laymangomez, but I digress.
Someone on our sub was saying it was to do with the luxury tax, but it surprised me that a league minimum signing would have that effect
I think it might be top 3 protected tbf, but tanking just ain't an option this year
Cavs with love Drummond and sexton are def better than us and I would say the same for the bulls so I disagree there

And if Jackson is a real nba starter going forward that’s good for us since he’s only 23. I don’t think he is but hope I am wrong there
I would agree it’s far from the best way to use are cap ya, buts it’s better then just doing nothing (taking on contracts like u said would be better)

I’m just saying it’s definitely gonna be a asset by the time he’s in his expiring year
Do we not have any better options? Or can we expect him to come out of the slump?
He wasn’t a league minimum signing though. We signed him to a training camp deal, and after preseason he was most likely going to command more than the minimum.
I would wait 5~10 games to judge because Layman was solid in preseason but was awful today so hopefully both our PF can figure out their role by then
[Other team's POV against the Celtics](https://twitter.com/overtime/status/1293640991111553027)
Perfect final 22 seconds there for Tatum. Plus the block on the DRose layup right before that. Clutch plays.
Good one Detroit. Let’s never play each other again
Jerami Grant is really good
Pistons are so weird
Jaylen Brown
Y’all really created a monster when you didn’t consider Jaylen Brown
A few takeaways:

* Toronto should feast tomorrow. Boston's third game in 4 nights on the road, both the last 2 games were tight and Boston losing Teague hurts.

* Blake shouldn't have been on the court in the final 2 minutes. Outside of a couple 3s, he was brutal. Svi and Hayes had a better case for being on the court over him, and he was playing SF for some reason. 

* that somehow successful play call of the fake DHO with Plumlee/Blake on Theis is gonna be the weirdest clutch ATO play of the season. Hard to top that one
jaylen and tatum with 0 FTA's. bruh
Jerami Grant is better than Pascal Siakam.
Can i take just a moment of your time to talk about future all-star Jerami Grant?
[deleted]
As good as Jaylen's game was, I think Tatum deserves player of the game there
Browns been putting up the most quiet 30 point games I’ve ever seen consistently this season. It’s fucking wild
Jayson “Point Foward” Tatum took a good game winning shot and Jaylen “Michael Jorden” Brown continues to prove his All-NBA run, love to see it 😤
Tatum called game
Jaylen Brown.
It's fun having Jayson and Jaylen on the same team. I'm glad Danny didnt trade them
Best Jays team since Toronto in ‘93
Technically the pistons won twice
As u/oronder said: Jaylen Brown, All Star.
Jaylen Brown
Did Detroit not have a timeout?
Can someone explain the Plumlee iso out of the timeout? That was a real head scratcher.
Blake mixing up tanking and straight up throwing
Is Blake coasting or is he actually that washed?
It's Jaylen Brown's world my pp's just living in it
Okay, seriously, what the fuck happened to our defense? The offense looks about how I'd expected given our lack of depth and any real starting PG, but I can't think of any goddamn reason why this team should be giving up 120 to the ***Pistons.***
I come out from watching the game with one lesson learned: Blake Griffin is done. Air-balled a three, short on a foul shot, can't move on defense, can't rise anywhere near his past hops, telefaxes his passes for defenses to read... how disappointing.
I used too think he would help Denver or a team that needs a PF. I don't think this is the case.
He might still have good games coming, and I will always love hime, but he ain't no good.
Tatum with a nice 24/8/12 + game winner.
So happy Tatum didn't settle for the step back 3 this time.
Man, all those takes about Brown being a reach at #3 and being overpaid have aged like fine wine if you're a Celtics fan.
Did the Pistons not have a timeout? NBA TV's broadcast said they did.
We didn’t have a time out but the broadcast was messed up all game
Win or lose I want it to be with the Jays for the long haul
Fun game, I like Boston's commentators a lot
Blake Griffin is the last person on the court you want to take that shot... it looked like it was a designed play for him. 
What are you thinking?
Jaylen got kinda iced in the second half, no reason for him to be so uninvolved on offense after that 1st half.
The Jays really stepped it up at the end there
Man that was ballsy as hell to swipe at the ball as Blake was going up for a 3. If you misjudge that you're sending him to the line to win the game with 3 FTs, but it paid off!
Blake griffin guarding Tatum on the last shot is not ideal lol
Trade Blake build around Jerami
Feel like everyone’s gonna be going off about Tatum and Brown but I just came away from that game feeling like the Celtics really don’t look that good. They got like 6 dudes you’re gonna be happy playing in a playoff series.

Also wtf was Steven’s doing that game
Not that this was key to the game, but where was Grant Williams this game? I can't find anything about him
Blake Griffin cost us that game, and I'm all for it.
Blake is WASHED
Blake Griffin was so bad in the last four minutes
Whats up with Blake?
Tank commander Blake doing his best
Good team win?
My thing with jeremi grant is that he is really good but he isn't better than murray or jokic so his bigger role wouldn't have come but damn I wish he played with us
The improvements Brown has made every season has been great to see as a NBA fan. He looked like a athletic defensive stopper but over the last few years he has the handles, jumpshot and scoring ability. Hope he makes all star this year.
Blake looking completely washed on those last two plays
Anyone interested in commenting on Jerami Grant? He is a bonafide asset and would fit on any contending team. If Detroit wants, they can get a nice haul for him.
The pistons had a time out couldn’t they have advanced the ball there!?
Tatum’s defense is still massively underrated
Blake Griffin costed Detroit this game tbh, some really poor shots and defense down the stretch
How did they barely win this game?
Now that's what I call tanking
JB MVP
Pistons do have a timeout, decide not to use it-
Did the pistons not have a timeout or was that a glitch?
so they didnt have a timeout to use, they used it when they went for the challenge and then another for the plumlee iso
Death, Taxes, Dwane Casey not having a timeout with under 10 seconds left
Pistons on paper look like a respectable team. I mean you have blake and D.rose for fucks sake, but idk? Weird?
Pistons fans: When did Josh Jackson become the starter? I knew he looked decent in the preseason and in the first few games, but the Pistons decide that a Rose/Hayes backcourt wasn't working out?
thought celts are gonna lose again
Ladies and gentlemen, Jaylen Brown
These games aren't good for my heart
I only tuned into the last two minutes, but the announcers I was listening to said the Pistons didn't have a timeout, but the scoreboard said they did (and I'm reading from other comments that other announcers said they did have one). So that's weird.

Also, not sure if Griffin was trying to draw a foul on the final shot, but he should know that will almost never get called at the end of the game. Odd choice for final shot, kind of think Grant should have tried something.
Griffin single handling losing the game for us.

Casey dumbfuck deserves to be fired after this.

I don't know why this coach believes Griffin could guard anyone, and specifically JAYSON TATUM.

Bricking 2 wide open 3 in crunch time and the last shot was horrible

Pistons is so fun to watch when Griffin sits, can't wait to see Casey fired and Griffin traded for 2 sandwich and one diet coke
Pistons had a timeout... wtf was that
[deleted]
Timeout??
These Celtics might have what it takes to get the 8 seed
Wtf Detroit had a time-out...
So who had a better game jaylen or tatum?
I’ve never seen so many posts by Celtics fans about the Jays after beating the *checks notes Detroit Pistons. Come on man lmao.
my fav video to come out of the bubble lol
"Look at him. Creepin' *ass*.”
i love their friendship lol
He's a monster.  It's still ridiculous that Siakam made the 2nd team over him last year.
Idk why our team only ever tries against the celtics
No more Detroit & Indiana
The Pistons broadcasters at one point were like "let's see what Denver thinks of Jerami Grant now"

....they literally offered him the same money and he chose to walk!!! How are people not getting this?!
Let them be weird elsewhere. I don’t wanna see them against my team again
Thank you
Jaylen Brown.
31 on 13/16 and the clutch 3 to take the lead. Followed by a Tatum game winner and game sealing block. I’m in love.
Counterpoint: Jaylen Brown
I hope Boston can keep him and Tatum together for a long time.
Jaylen Brown shits with the door open because *this is his house*
GET ON BOARD THE O'JAYS LOVE TRAIN
Jaylen. Brown.
Jayson Tatum
Ya..... that’s nice and all but, have you considered Jaylen Brown?
Jaylen Blacked tonight
Jaylen Down from Browntown!!!
It's really a shame his nickname isn't The Consideration.
For some reason, Blake was isolated against Smart at the top of the key at the end of the game. If you listened closely, you could hear the "oh shit"s bouncing inside his head
Lmaoooo it was so funny to see us come out the timeout with 45 seconds left, and go with a Plumlee iso
Svi looks quite capable, it’s grim for Detroit if they start seeing Griffin the way a neutral fan does.
Not sure about Raps feasting they looked pretty bad.
Jayson's not doing enough to draw FT's, but Jaylen's just getting scammed.
Jaylen Brown is better than Pascal Siakam.
Who isn't better than Pascal Siakam is the real question
RJ Barrett is better than Pascal Siakam
That dude is so fun to watch. Excited to watch him play against not my team.
I didn’t think it would work out. I’ll admit when I am wrong tho, he’s looking great.
Don’t tell our idiot fans
He’s been inconsistent and took way too many bad shots recently but this game he was good.
I think Tatum is a clutch player but no he hasn't been particularly clutch this year
12 assists 0 turnovers, 24 points, the game winner, and 2 game saving blocks.
How so?
The scorebug said they did but the Pistons broadcast said they didn't and nobody seemed to even think about taking a timeout so I'm assuming the ticker was wrong.
no, TV error
The screen said they did, but the announcers said they didn't. Who knows tbh, imma assume the graphic was wrong.
the scoreboard on the detriot broadcast has been fucked up for a lot of the game
Nah they took one at 49s and then one at 34s
No
Nope
They did lol

Now they're saying they didn't. Idk I was watching the Pistons stream and it showed 1 timeout still left
They decided not to use it...
Nope
they decided not to use it with 3 seconds left(!)

edit: scorebug apparently, so no timeout left
Its Dwane Casey, it can't be explained
It did end up bringing 2 pts
he looked out of shape. Lost his legs in the 4th on both ends
So far he looks just washed. He's actually been a leader and a high effort guy in Detroit and he's been helping the young guys along. It just looks like injuries have done him in. It's kind of sad to see though. I'm hoping I'm wrong and he's just starting slow though.
Black hole on offense so far this year and every young guy defers to him which isn't helping their own development
It's Jayson Tatum's world my pp's just living in it
They made Svi Michaleuk look like Michael Jordan in the 4th
Maybe he is simply not interested in playing for team with no future?
Or pizza dough, considering many if not most of those takes were coming from Celtics fans
Our local broadcast team said we didn’t but the graphics said we did I’m not really sure
The Boston broadcast didn't show one.
They didn’t
The dude on NBA TV was very unenthused
Mike Gorman is a pro's pro man
It looked more like a relay throw from the outfield than a gamewinning basketball shot
Tatum was that dude in the 2nd half tho
For real, the way he was shooting he should've had at least 40 tonight.
Just means he'll have more in the tank for father/son time with Spinny P tomorrow
He got switched on Tatum. Im assuming that was the play call by Brad
Where would he get traded too though? 

The dudes expensive and injury prone, not performing that well, idk what team would take that risk
I wish man. If he was playing great it would be extremely difficult. Playing the way he is makes him completely impossible to move
Lol no one would take him
Still missing kemba
Celtics wouldn’t have won that game if Blake wasn’t on the court the last 2 minutes, i’m not salty or anything, but Griff really cost the game
He's been playing for a decade and has some bad Injuries under his belt, dudes washed
got them old man knees
He looked pretty bad last year, this year has been much worse. Even just watching him run it doesn’t look good
I’d rather keep him and build around him, dude’s been playing like an all-star honestly.
I don't think they did. At least the celtics local broadcast didn't show one.
Don’t think we did, was a mistake on the broadcast
Never doubt our ability to play against the Celtics
Did not have one
Glitch
Both are well past their primes though. It's similar to that 2018 cavs team with Wade, rose, love, jefferson, etc. On paper an amazing all time team. In reality a bunch of old guys who can barely keep up.
Lol why would they fire the coach. They are tanking hard
They didn't it was a typo on the NBA TV score board. They used two in the last 2minutes
I think its close but tatum is more useful overall with defense snd playmaking, brown couldve had like 45 of he didnt turn it over 6-7 times tonight by the end of the season its gonna be so nice to see what this duo looks like. Glad they on my team
First half was all Jaylen. Tatum clutched big on both sides of the court in the second half.

They both had good games and I'm just happy with the turnout
I think Tacko being taught how to swim might top it for me.
I don't think the raps were happy about that. It triggered the option in his contract and made his extension even bigger. Instead of 25% of the cap he now gets 28%
Ive never seen a play ride a good two months and make it over two player that are so much better then him in Tatum and Middleton.
No it's not. He averaged almost the exact same stats on a better seed with less talent. It's ridiculous to say that him getting it is ridiculous
Because fuck the Celtics obviously
Well he walked because he didn’t get the role he wanted, he came here just because he wanted a bigger offensive role

Denver promised him to be the 3rd option but he wanted more than that
I dont understand players sometimes. WIth the same money, some prefer to be the main man on a non-contender than being a 3rd guy in a contender.
Honestly takin this as a compliment 😌🤝
Yeah they showed up against us. I actually think they played better today than they did in their win.
~~Michael Jordan~~ Jaylen Brown
Jaylen. Brown
Blake Griffin
Don't forget Tatum's 12 assists and 0 turnovers.
I don’t think being on OJ’s love train ends well for anyone...
It is now.  Good job bud
The Celtics hunted specifically for that matchup. Brown said they were looking to isolate Griffin
I’ve never yelled at my tv for a January regular season game of teams I’m not a fan of until that moment
He clowned Theis tho, I was furious that it worked.
I think he has more leeway from our fans because he just had a concussion and is still coming back from that heavy knee injury last season
We might feast if we had a reliable scorer on our team, but Pascal hasn't been a reliable scorer since December of 2019. Lowry can create his own shot but isn't that kind of player (usually).

Unless FVV hits an absurd amount of 3-pointers, nobody's "feasting", because nobody on our team has the capability to "feast".
TPE is better than siakam. Didn’t foul out tonight
everyone is better the pascal siakam, even Dudley
This take is milder than Hunts ketchup
That was settled in September.  Grant and Siakam is now on the table.
I have all 3 in fantasy lmao. Siakam letting me the fuck down
Bruh the ship has sailed on that one for a while
[deleted]
He is clutch.

But he seriously hurts himself when he takes bad shots at the end of games - that’s what Celtics fans are upset about.

I get he’s arguably the best in the NBA at deep, contested, step-back threes... but why is he even taking that shot when we’re tied or down less than 3 at the end of the game?

What he did tonight is what I’d love to see going forward.
He is clutch but he has also been taking awful shots. They're not mutually exclusive.
No you're an idiot
And consistent double teams, many of which lead to Brown being open
Tank math
Ez tank
The scoreboard was tripping all day 

After halftime it said it was 0-0 for a while then 0-59 for a little bit
I'm pretty sure it didn't reset to 2 timeouts at the 3 min mark, like it should've.
Celtics broadcast showed none.
Tank Commander Blake fulfilling his role
They didn’t the graphic was messed up they had 3 but it went under 2 min so they lost one but the graphic didn’t update.
Griffin from way downtown
I’m not denying it worked but it just took me by surprise lol.
His playstyle has completely changed now he lives outside the 3 point like and occasionally post up. I have never seen a guy change their playstyle that dramatically
On the bright side, you'd probably rather have Blake's contact than Siakam's
It’s the Jay’s world my pp’s just living in it
Jay vs Jay: fate of two pps
No future? Future is quite literally ALL we have
Our local graphics didn't show any
Yeah when Tatum was out and making good plays its fine but it got kinda painful at times when he was sitting and Brown was still just in the corner while someone else pounded the ball.
He had 6-7 turnovers
It most definitely was. Any scouting report of us should know how to exploit Blake on the perimeter. He has no ability to stay in front.
Yeah they were probably hunting him. Shouldn’t have been out there honestly he was not moving well at all
On the stream I was listening to it showed they had a timeout, the announcer said they did too right before that final play.
Nbatv broadcast definitely had a timeouts:1 under the pistons.
Okay good cause otherwise that’s pretty embarrassing. Also there’s been so many technical issues since the season has started, delayed audio, shot clock constantly doesn’t start running, stretches of no audio at all in some preseason games. I hope the league works on this going into the second half of the season
If he bench young guys like Svi, Sekou, Stewart to give more minutes to Wright, Griffin and Okafor

WHY WE NEED TO TANK HARD TO DRAFT WELL IF HE WILL NOT PLAY ROOKIES????
Or Tobias watching Boban walking with Luka outside
The Beyblade effect!
I know it's open season on siakam lol but this is a ridiculous statement. He was the second best player on a championship team.
Well except for Tatum having better efficiency, defense, and advanced stats
That’s such an oversimplistic way of looking at it
Wings v Bruins too. Whole city hates y'all.
He wouldn't even be 3rd option with MPJ
being the main guy lets you put up more points, which in theory gets you more money on the following contract.
He's young he doesn't desire a ring rn just a fat contract. He can put up more points and be the guy and elevate to the next tier in Detroit. And this will net him a bigger contract in the future
There’s something to be said about going from an established organization to being a huge part of building a startup.
You should. You guys play with a bunch of heart. Respect to your ball club
You 100% should.
I thought that’s just MJ’s real name
Glake Briffin
Incredible. I’m so glad to see his playmaking improving and the rest of the team, especially Ojeleye, making shots
Consider it done
Damn, I thought for sure Pascal would bounce back. Is he injured or anything? Weird minutes or some explanation?
Cash Considerations *and* Jaylen Considerations looking better than Siakam.
If this motion passes, we progress to Gary Trent Jr. is better than Siakam.
Griffin can at least transition into a useful old man game player.
Celtics fans in r/bostonceltics are upset about literally whatever they can moan about, its a cesspool. 

You're right though.
He’s 22. And he has two game winners already this year. He will figure it out
Yeah. Why did they leave Brown of all people open? I'd rather have the ball in anyone's hands except for Tatum and Brown if I was the Pistons.
Best part is that it seems like Tatum's done struggling with those consistent double teams

Jays learn too fast watch out
Yeah I think Josh Jackson scored a 59 pointer to open the second half
This has been a problem for us all season, idk why. Feels like theres new software being used or a new production crew or something. It was super bad to start the season, scores would randomly be 4 digits per team out of a quarter and stuff lol.
CLANK CLANK
https://youtu.be/_asNhzXq72w
Oh me too.
So say we all
In hindsight, why was he in the court at all on that play?
Because Blake play worse than the rookies lol
They're not just gonna sit Blake while paying him 40 million a year.

My guess is at some point, he'll come down with something and miss the last 30 games or so. Then we just have to wait out his contract 1 more year. Can we stop with the he doesnt play rookies stuff, Killian has been bad and is playing, what,  24 minutes a game?
And that was two years ago. Not last year.
Lowry was the second best player on that team. I thought that was pretty clear since he ran that offense all year. Also what he did that year has no bearing on what he did last year.
What does any of that have to do with the 2019-20 season and the All-NBA teams?
not last year he wasn't
Yeah and Krillin is the second-strongest student of Master Roshi's
Tatum's TS was 2 percent higher. That's not some massive difference. He also did not play better defense either. That is revisionst history. Tatum may have had better advanced stats, but he also had significantly more talent. Siakam deserved it over him due to that. Was the number one option with a better record while having considerably less talent.
Ok so tell me how to look at it
Goes even deeper. The Source vs Eminem was Boston vs Detroit as well.
Well that’s on the Nuggets for not valuing him properly. Grant is our best player and playing at an all-star level.
And also some people just wanna be the main guy.

Ain't wrong with that either. Not everyone wants to be bench bitch #4029
And like Paul Pierce said, most guys rather have a Max contract than a Ring
Respect man, Tatum-Brown marks a new golden generation for your team, and Pritchard looks like a gem (FVV vibes). Hope we meet in the ECF in a few years
Jlake Briffin
I’m here for it.  That’s an incredible nickname.  That dude should seriously be proud.  Unless it’s been said before but I honestly haven’t heard it
He just kinda stopped doing the stuff that made him a good player to begin with. People like to make memes about his spin-move, but he doesn't really use it anymore. It's mostly weak post-ups and 3s.

I have to assume it's mental, because he shows flashes of that old Siakam now and again, but he's just not playing as well as he used to, and I don't really know how to explain it.
Yes, we're on the same page, fella.
Once the man stops taking deep stepbacks on the dpoty that somehow bank in, my heart can rest at ease.
wouldn't say this, he's the bulk of the way there but the doubles do bother him, I'd be fearful of these doubles if they were coming from snappier ball-pressure defenders like Beverley, PG, and Kawhi.

the real problem with the doubles against the Celtics is that our team has some low-skill passers and handlers taking up minutes we gave to Kemba and Gordon last year, so like ... if the open man isn't near Jayson, we're unlikely to make the series of 3 or 4 passes that breaks the play open. It's the same reason we struggle against zone defense, we play like 3 good passers at a time *max.* I'm blabbering but my point is the Jays are gonna be a loooot more dominant when we get Kemba and the TPA out there.
Just had to sacrifice his ankle for it
I saw Detroit’s broadcast and they had the 0-0 glitch. The announcers assured the viewers that this wasn’t the craziest game ever lol
One can only guess. He's the face of the team and having him on the bench at the end of the game might not make him or Tom Gores happy.
So his efficiency was......better. And Tatum had better defensive stats, more All-Defensive votes, and looked better by my eye test.  Also Siakam's team must have been super talent depleted to go 7-5 in the games he missed.
Siakam regressed throughout the season. By the end of the season he looked horrid. Tatum had the exact opposite effect.

On top of that, the Raptors won most of their games because they had the highest scoring bench in the league iirc, while Boston was riddled with injuries and had a pretty short rotation most of the season.

Just because Toronto finished above Boston by about 2 games doesnt mean Siakam was better than Tatum.
Toy Solider such an underrated song, good lord it holds up.
Lol how is Denver supposed to value him any higher??? Jokic and Murray are better players than him! But he was definitely the third guy in the playoffs. The whole point is that Denver didn’t do anything wrong, it’s just that Grant wants to be the guy.
Y’all literally valued him the exact same as we did if you paid him the same lol.

Grant is a great player but quit acting like we were stupid for not signing him. We tried but your team just happened to be a better fit for what he was looking for.
Yeah he may be your best player but he's not the Nuggets third best player lmao
Would love to see it. Grant looks like a great signing and Killian Hayes was my favorite player outta last year's draft. You guys are definitely building something special
Stewart plays with a lot of grit and Bey and Doumboya are better than any of our bench players. You can be really solid once you are out of Blakes contract.
Shouldve waited to do it in the finals
Yes his efficiency was better. But that 2 percent gap does not overcome the fact that Siakam had a higher seed with less talent. Seeding plays a big part in voting. Tatum was working with Kemba,Brown,Hayward, and Smart. Siakam had Lowry,FVV,Ibaka, OG. Clearly you can see the gap in the rosters.
Why does the end of the season matter more than the beginning? All games matter the same. Raptors had a better bench. Celtics had a better starting lineup. Which one is more important. Brown, Hayward, and Kemba were all averaging close to 20 ppg. Siakam had a higher seed with less talent and that's what it came down to in the end, especially when their counting stats were so similar
No the Nuggets should have let him be the first option over a top 10 player and Murray
It's pretty obvious how flawed your argument is when it's just team achievements like seeding attributed to one player.
It matters because teams buckle down and play harder by the end of the season. That slump carried into the bubble and playoffs where he looked terrible.

Even if you take averages, Tatum had higher PER, TS%, WS, WS/48, BPM, DBPM, OBPM, VORP. 

He was better by pretty much every advanced metric. He also played 6 more games. Not to mention he is a much better defender too.

The only reason Siakam finished above is because of seeding, which as I already said, is an oversimplistic way of looking at it.
That's literally how voting works. They almost had identical stats and one had a higher seed than the other. One was working with three people who were averaging close to 20 PPG. The other one wasn't and still finished with a higher seed.
But thats how the voting works
> One was working with three people who were averaging close to 20 PPG. The other one wasn't and still finished with a higher seed.

You've got to be trolling me at this point.  Your argument is Siakam didn't have scoring help?

[Toronto Raptors become first team in 46 years to have five players average at least 15 points per game](https://ca.nba.com/news/2019-20-toronto-raptors-become-first-team-since-1973-74-to-have-five-players-average-at-least-15-ppg/1jei68zeordy61bupj0psq8sa9#:~:text=With%20Pascal%20Siakam%2C%20Kyle%20Lowry,70%25%20of%20their%20team's%20games.)
What a shit excuse lmao.

“Voting wasnt wrong because that’s how voting works” 

Do you even hear yourself? Nice try though
So they weren't averaging close to 20 ppg?  You cannot seriously be trying to tell me that the Raptors roster was better than the Celtics roster.
Excuse? That's how the voting process works. Seeding plays a big part
Which is something you rejected in your first reply lol. You tried to prove that it wasnt due to seeding, but due to performance. Youre just shifting goalposts at this point.

Either way, Im not gonna waste my time arguing with someone who bases his judgement entirely on the W/L column
ben 10/12 on FTs is a fat nut
Seth is so huge for this team.
Jerami Grant going 3-19, 2-8 from deep is just brutal.
Honestly my biggest takeaway from tonight is yet another instance where hack a Ben didn’t work. 

Big FT there from him. 

Good game. Pistons came to play. Shot lights out for long stretches
Boy that was an ugly game.  The Sixers playing on the road in a b2b is always ugly but if it ends with Ws then who cares
Simmons got his first 20 pt game of the season and was great  at the FT line, including the clutch.

GG Detroit. See you soon
Ben is doing Ben things again, shutdown on Grant who was having a 20+pts streak for 14 games. He ended tonight with 11pts in 3/19 FG. Jo gave all Piston centers a workout and then some.
[deleted]
Embiid hit his next level this year, and its glorious.
My brow was sweatin
TRUST THE PROCESS
Ben Simmons stocks 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
lets go baby just keep getting this wins. really want a top 2 seed this year.
Why did Grant have a bad game? Didn't get the chance to watch, didn't know the Sixers were playing tonight lol.
Joel, Seth and Harris all having career years at the same time is working really well
Lmao we were lucky Ben and Jo were alive this game because our bench has been fucking brutal
Hack-a-Ben don’t work! 😤
9-0 with our full starting lineup
Ben scoring 20 points with 5 FG is a stat!
Simmons is starting to hit some good form so hopefully he continues it, if he gets 15-20 a night on top of his defensive prowess that’s a huge problem for other teams
The MVP train rolls on
Bench was doo-doo tonight but we won so it’s chill 
Dudes was real tired tonight you could tell
Ben Simmons haters where ya at?
Joel Embiid good give upvote
Pistons with 7 guys in double digits but noone above 20. I don’t have anything to say about that just thought it was neat
Yeah.. I've seen enough. Ben is DPOY for sure so far.
Hack-a-Ben is dead.  ^^^This ^^^is ^^^semi-sarcastic; ^^^please ^^^don't ^^^jinx ^^^it
Joel EMVPIID
I have always loved Embiid's shot form, for a big man I think it's one of the best. Which is why it always confused me why he was an inconsistent shooter for so long. Seems like it was the system that was the problem the entire time. 

He's getting much better looks now and is probably playing more confidently now that he has decent scoring threats around him.
wait Wayne Ellington is still in the league? and he put up 17 points??
Ben had Jerami Grant in jail
Simmons, Thybulle, and Green is good as it gets for defensive wings.
10 9 8
Mason Plumlee is not a good basketball player
MVPbiid
BEST TANKING TEAM EVER!
This game certainly happened.

But if you asked me about it tomorrow i probably already forgot anything that happened today.
josh jackson looks a lot better than I remember
Geez! Embiid is a monster
EMVPiid
I hope Detroit gets Cade
MVPiid
mvp
Joel Embiid
Thybulle almost costed us the game, he needs to do way better than tonight.
Ben really trying to get that DPOY award. 

My dude terrorized poor Jeremiah Grant
6'ers are scary this year man. As a jazz fan who hopes the jazz can get there they are definitely my nightmare matchup in the east if we miraculously beat the Lakers
That 7/8 FTs by Simmons tho
Welcome to my "Embiid MVP run" comments only karma account.
what a wonderful tank
How do you go 1/10 from 2 & only take 4 FTs
Dwight has been giving me flashbacks. Hasn't looked great.
Sorry i think i missed out on something. Whats happening with the pistons? Isnt that they are one of the most active last offseason and seems to add every player 7ft tall?
Man, Blake is really starting to worry me
I knew the Pistons were bad record wise, but I didn't expect it to be 3-13..
The sixers literally passed the chance to become title favorites in order to keep a rookie who at best will become the 1/4 that harden is because he played good 2 games with g leaguers , and to keep 3 late first round picks
How is it that someone so phenomenonally gifted and talented like Ben Simmons can shoot so poorly? I'm honestly baffled. He will probably end up as one of the biggest "What ifs" I've seen when all is said and done.
With free throws in the clutch
Put the clamps on Grant too
He really is. With Tobias and Curry running on all cylinders and Green providing key scoring it opens up the game so much more for Embiid to do what he does.
And with 0-3 from 3 too he was still that impactful
One of the best contracts in the league too. Can't believe Morey pulled that off.
Ben Simmons
He’s gonna be checking under his bed for Ben Simmons for a while.
Ben Simmons effect
0/13 when guarded by Simmons lol
That’s what happens when you run up against a brick wall that has hands and steals your wallet and also moves around so no matter what happens you just can’t move. And then you get around that was finally just to see *another* even taller wall.
Simmons Prison is not a joking matter!
The kids play so hard, I get excited when Blake and/or Rose sit.
Remember last year when every road game was already an L, no matter who we played.
Whine about a b2b all you want but the Pistons were also on one and had Rose (and Blake, but that's not a detriment) out.

I know we suck but we're supposed to. All of our losses are close so we're pretty fired up about the tank job.
I really like the home-and-home schedule this season. So much better seeing how teams perform against each other in consecutive games.
No, we won't see you soon.

We'll see you later.
0/13 when guarded by Ben LOL
That’s a yummy stat line from Ben guarding grant
Lol Joel didn't look like he gave a shit about that game from the start
MVPiid
I mean it’s weird to say but this might’ve been one of his worst games of the season, and he still put up 33 14 with good defense and shooting 50%
We’ll see 40 games in ^_^
Were your knees weak?
They hate the process.
Shit boi gimme that top spot
Ben Simmons.
Jerami Grant is like the quintessential type of player that Ben Simmons excels at locking up
Ben Simmons
Paging Mr. Simmons
WHY DIDNT WE THINK OF THIS BEFORE
shake had a nice little late run but yeah we could use a scoring wing off the bench. Those furk threes helped i guess
Our 3-spot is a bit weak. Definitely a hole in the roster. I’m sure Morey is working on it. Even if we add a replacement level player it would help. We need insurance in case this is as good as Thybulle gets.
Might have to trade Danny Green to sort this out
Has it ever?
Also undefeated when Joel and Curry play
It was especially nice to see him driving tonight and not shying away from contact. That is a huge key to opening up his game, even without a three point shot.
Probably waiting until he has a bad game. Wish they’d use their energy on something productive lol
He had a good game today, but I’m sick of this comment. He’s had plenty of bad games in wins but fans just give him a pass cause we won.

He’s been bad this season
Got you
With fucking pleasure my dude
Easy to upvote when you speak facts
everyone who went into the game scored some points. Pretty good I guess.
We might have the MVP, DPOY, and 6th Man of the year all at once.
he's actually really clutch in end game ft's.
I hope it is. I don’t even care if it means that he is doing better but it makes the games more enjoyable to watch. Hack-a-Blank strategies are so boring to watch but it will never go away cause of how effective they are.
This season he's been much more selective with his threes. He used to jack up threes when he was tired, or when there's a closeout to keep people jumping at his pump fake. Now he'll pretty much only shoot it if he's got miles of space or if he's really feeling it in MVBiid mode, and it's resulted in a way higher percentage
He’s picking his spots better, especially from 3.
Yeah, he actually set the record tonight for most threes in a 4-game span in Pistons history with 21 made threes. Still an underrated shooter.
He looked legit
Wayne and Danny Green both out here tonight repping 2009 UNC Championship team!
I was impressed with Currys double teams. Timed to perfection.

Also Harris has turned up his D to 11.
76ers
76ers
Fouled out for the 4th straight game.
That out of bounds screen lmao
how *dare* you
I really think he's gonna figure it out. So young still.
He scored 29 earlier this year, but missed a few games with an ankle sprain. I'm sure he'll pick it back up again and get up into the 20s more often.
He needs to find his 3pt shot again.  He's hopefully in a slump and not regressing.  At least his defense is great.
Terrorized him so much that he had to change his name!
10/12
He’s better than any backup C Embiid has ever had.
He does two things very well, rebound and foul.
he's just such a low IQ player with stone hands
The pistons are not trying to win, but they were very clearly avoiding the obvious looking tank. They signed a couple of young projects for cheap, and a handful of guys who are likely going to have some value to teams once the deadline comes. every game but 1 has been within 10 pts, with 3 of them going to OT.

All of their trading gave them 3 first round picks this year. One is injured but should be back at some point (hopefully he isn't starting again), and the other 2 are playing notably decently well already. 

So Detroit is executing the best tank this season. They have the fewest wins, but arguably are the "best" of the worst. Once Blake Griffin is off the books, thats when the real upward mobility starts.
Only one loss has been by 10 or more last I checked

Most our games have been pretty close
First in the east, 3 games lost were from games that should've been postponed. I think we're alright.
Don't discount late first round picks as far as the Sixers go. Korkmaz, Thybulle, and Maxey were all late first round picks. For as many problems as they have had, those late first rounders are what has provided them more bench depth than they have had since the 2017-18 season. Can't say the same for the Nets, who have just dropped two straight with their new big 3.
Classic NBA flair 💕🥵❤️😍🤤
Lmao
We don’t know that. Daryl was probably being diligent by holding back his best offer and expected his friend and former colleague Stone to give him a last shot. But he didn’t. BKN came with the godfather offer and Stone said yes. That’s it.
Harden is barely playing like he’s the superstar he was on the rockets fuck outta here
Ben was great tonight. 

Even if this is as good as Ben ever is, a DPOY caliber defender who averages a near triple double is pretty fucking valuable.
They really waited for him to get it to foul him and he put them both in.
He just doesn’t miss free throws in the clutch. It escapes me how people haven’t realised this yet.
Lol Simmons has been clamping people up this season
Let's not forget embiid is playing better period. Playing at a much better pace
Had great D and timed his double teams to perfection
His contract is uniquely valuable to a team with two all-defense level talents in the starting five in Simmons and Embiid.

You can't just put him on like the Kings and have him work in the starting 5.
man needs to fire his agent
he was one of the biggest reasons for our success in the WCF finals run. maybe the most underrated player in the league, but that may be changing now he is starting for a contender. dude is a good ball handler, not a bad defender at all, and obviously is lights out from three. doesn’t miss open looks.
Him and RJ gonna set up a private clubhouse with salt around it to ward off Ben Simmons.
That's what happens when someone taller, stronger and better than you takes your crown and makes you dance for his amusement.
Reasonably so. Svi played extremely hard, Jackson was the best I’ve personally seen him play, impressed by Sekou and Stewart. 

At this point where the Pistons stand, it’s much more meaningful to see those guys ball out
This year I was thinking, "Man, I can't think of an actual dogshit team, except maybe the Pistons" from looking at just win/loss. But I was wrong, they play really hard even with starters out.
But every home game was a W
Also it just makes sense for travel purposes. I know baseball does series that way
Lmaoo
Still dropped his 30 tho
Sleepy Joe gets his 30 and 10 without even trying.
Actually, that was one of the most active games I’ve seen Joel play in a while. The young center (I forget his name) on the pistons off the bench really made him work. There were some fighting possessions I bet Joel’s sore as hell today. He ain’t playing next game I bet.
Emvpiid
Unrelated but thanks for giving Best Curry a chance to play on an actual contender. Mark Cuban is such a charitable guy.
Deal.
palms sweaty
Living rent free in their heads
Thought so! Didn't want to assume though. He's so good lol
Yeah good footwork and strong shooter, not much ball security. Bad matchup for Jerami.
My favorite player!
Ben is nice man
well, we didnt have a Seth before
I think we need to start giving Joe a little burn again. He’s a volume three-point shooter, and one we can even run next to Furk if need be.
Where's Mike Scott?
[deleted]
I kinda agree but I also really like Danny
I don’t know if Hack-a-Player works for most situations, but it certainly doesn’t seem to for Ben. Tired legs seem to make his FTs better.
Lmao. He has a good 5 quarters and the felchers come out in full force.
nah
it’s never been effective though. he’s never been THAT bad at FTs
Every questionable tactic must be deliberate. otherwise they just make no sense. Casey is playing 4d chess with his own career.
I respect the process, but going about it this way ensures the fact that the league won't hate us forever.
No doubt. He shows flashes of being great defensive player, but sometimes he makes some stupid fouls that make people bothered. Hopefully he will get better on his game when he has more feel to the game as the season goes.
Which is sad when a couple rebounds, a missed dunk, and four or five turnovers from offensive fouls from moving screens is an improvement.
I'm always expecting the missed dunk as well
cant compain about that man as long as the tank is rolling but the guys play with heart
Nice at least they're keeping it close. Thanks pistons bud
Don't take b8 friend.
And just snuck by a Heat team without Jimmy or Herro. Bam scored 40 something - I think that might be good news for Joel.
I started watching NBA as a clippers fan but also a huge LeBron supporter , and now I don't know who to support 😂
Crazy thing is, Ben WANTED to get fouled at the end. He held that shlt, while it was a 2 point game with 20 seconds left lol. CLUTCH
He looks way less like sluggish. Really fluid & loose
Last year everybody was just playing in slow motion. This year Doc’s got everybody just shooting the damn ball if they’re gonna shoot, or passing and making decisions faster. Tobias is getting a lot of recognition for it but the whole team looks faster and more fluid overall.
He’s moving soooo fluid this season, it’s art
Definitely more valuable for the Sixers than other teams, but 69th (nice) highest paid guard is good value for any team when it comes with that offensive production. He's been putting up a good amount of effort on defense too, which has been a nice bonus.

If you have any faith in advanced stats like VORP they have him rated as a top 50 player so far this season. I thought the trade was pretty even, but it's starting to look like Morey robbed them
Uh yeah you can. He's a low usage career 45% 3pt shooter with decent defense that can play some 2. He can start for any team that doesn't have 2 star guards in their backcourt.
Maybe him and Steph have a Morris Brothers situation and he’s got access to that Supermax money.
i just think its not every guy is money hungry? yeah you and i will assume/agree that you gotta take the most money available.. but maybe he values playing for good teams more than some extra millions? I mean, his brother is steph and his dad is dell... dude isnt exactly hard out to begin with
It's great. Let the rookies, Svi, Sekou, Jackson play.  Get Killian healthy, make sure Grant doesn't have to play Simmons too often, and hopefully add a top 3 pick and we might finally have something to start getting excited about over here.

Especially when Blake's 40 million finally comes off the books next year.
I truly believe we are in a much better place than most would give us credit. We're bad in the sense we're not winning, but not bad in the traditional "worst team in the league" ways. It really is the perfect tank.
Every game is a road game this season. NBA aint seen philly at his best wait till they get REAL home games
With 162 games you kinda have to, if they had to travel again after every game or two the offseason would be like 2 weeks long lol

In normal years a series is usually 3 or 4 games played at the same park, although there are occasional 2 game series especially for interleague play. Then the team goes somewhere else and might get a day off depending on schedule or they might not, especially if they aren't traveling too far. Playing stretches of 10+ games with at least one every day is common.
When a 30 bomb is just another day.
He wakes up and shits 30/10
lol check his username
Bruh. Sixers aren’t a contender. No way does the leader of a contender go 0-11 with 0 points at any point in time. Enjoy the conference finals sixers. That’s all you’ll ever get.
mom's spaghetti
arms heavy?
He really is! Tremendous effort tonight by him (and Embiid and Tobi) on the second night of a back-to-back.
Furk and Joe together is a bucket for the other team
injured. But i don’t think he’d really help on this scenario lol
Jesus Christ it's his second year, and the roster got even more stacked for shooters better than him which means he gets less time to develop.
Even at his worst, he's a 10/10/10 kind of player while being a DPOY candidate. The anti-Ben squad is like "But he only scores like 16 PPG" ignoring the fact *he doesn't need to do more always*

If he puts up 8 points, it's usually on 4 shots at most and he'll have 12 assists and be +15. THE HORROR.
Hmm, that is a thing that has screwed us over in the past...
Can't upvote this enough lol
How about your back? You could use a spine.
Been underrated every point in his career oddly.

The fact that Morey traded Josh Richardson on an expiring contract, for curry locked up for 3 years is insane.
It also helps when you're not the only rich person in your family.
Agreed. Pistons have desperately needed to commit to a full rebuild for a few years and with this upcoming draft class, it’s an ideal time. Get a top pick, develop the yoinked guys and let em run
And remember, once Blake is in his last year his contract becomes a huge trade asset. Salary match for a star if you guys want to try to pull a Kawhi gambit with a rental on a disgruntled star surrounded by good role players and young talent.
That's what I was thinking seeing most teams perform this season so far. There really isn't an easy automatic W for anybody this season unless you're the Lakers with everybody available.
Who hurt you
More of a contender than 8-8 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

But Dallas sports fans know all about that.
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out?
As soon as I found out they were playing a back-to-back I got scared for an L. Really glad they played well though!
It is, but it’s one of those emergency rotations in case a guy like Seth is taking the night off, and for times when we REALLY need buckets
That is such a ridiculously juvenile way to look at basketball. It’s not as simple as “look at his pretty double digit numbers”. And he’s not scoring 16ppg. It’s 13. The lack of scoring pressure he puts on the other teams defense in the half court in the playoffs will come back to bite us in the ass.
We're lucky that the draft is so deep this year with the early picks. I'm not so sure Weaver can work his magic and get 3 more this time around, but we'll take what we can get.
it is. still sad the blazers didnt keep him. rodney hood is closer to josh richardson than seth curry
And your father in law is the coach
It must be nice to go into a game with legit confidence that you can win
Lol look at his username. Weird.
Hey. Didn’t y’all get swept by the Celtics first round? Lul.
Tough year. It happens. But it's not all bad. I mean, we could never have won a playoff series for nearly a decade. That would be really sad.
Tough year with three all stars.
They had 2? And one of them didn't play that series? Ah I see. You don't actually watch games. Makes sense why you're username is a box score.
A very relevant box score. Embiid shut down. Weak. Wont achieve anything with Tobias and Benny
Blake Griffin really might retire within the next two seasons at this rate and that just hurts.

His body has given up on him so fast. It’s been the only bad part of the season for me.
Fucking refs this game man.  Hope this same crew aint working the entire seven game homestand.
Welp, since we’re here...

https://youtu.be/pzFxwYWnttc
Thank God we showed up after that Pels game. I need more Sunny in my life
Gg Detroit. Really like Bey and Stewart they’re ballers.
Blake and CP3 were bound to go their separate ways but not like this...
Point. God.
A good clean(ish) win with a fairly thin roster, we'll take it. Especially after the last performance against the Pistons.
Seeing Blake like this makes me sad, man. Feel bad for him
Don't know why the other thread gor deleted, but here we go again.

Wasn't the most exciting game, but after the last matchup with Detroit, nobody on the Phoenix side wanted excitement. Just a clean, decisive win, which it was.

GG Detroit.
It’s great to see the Pistons successfully tank for once.
Man. Chris Paul might survive in the NBA longer than Blake Griffin.
And here I was expecting starting Kaminsky to be a disaster.... alright I guess..
Cam Johnson is a baller
Can anyone get a replay of the booker offensive foul at the end of the game? I’m still baffled that they didn’t overturn that.
[Get ready for more Frank the Tank in the starting lineup](https://twitter.com/KellanOlson/status/1357910870823632898?s=20)
Got the record correct.
Man what happened to Blake Griffin
I truly hope Blake gets somewhat of his form back. This is sad
Free Grant!
Body betrayed him quick like Hazard
I hate to say it but he looked done. I feel so bad for him (from a basketball perspective, not a money perspective). His days with CP3 were incredible.
Kicked our ass one more time of course
Check out his salary and you won't feel so bad.
most likely because of the wrong sun's record in the title (it had 13-9 instead of 12-9)
Book was just naturally following through with his foot. His defender is running horizontally into his legs too possibly into his landing area. Terrible call.
lol stop saying this he chose the bag and a place he can be the first option
Bro nowhere is safe
I feel bad. He gave his leg trying to win one game.
Eh, I still feel bad.
Ah. Didn't even notice. Thanks.
Oh I saw the play and couldn’t believe it at the time. Just wish there was a video of it to rewatch.
That ain’t stopping nba players from wanting to be free 🤷🏿‍♂️
NBA: Nonsensical Bitch-made Administration
I doubt he wants to leave considering the reasons he’s given for coming to Detroit.
for real. he just went from 4/5th option to 1st and is justifying the bag he got. He's in Detroit for the foreseeable future of his deal.
Zion heard the Suns fans and he wants to tell them to go to hell for calling him not an AllStar
Those plays where Zion runs the court to beat the clock before the end of a quarter are just magnificent
It really is a blessing to be able to watch Zion and BI grow every game. So excited for our future with those two leading the way. We’re going streaking!!!

###[YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS!!!](https://youtu.be/3SQa48DcX1E)  | [HEY DETROIT](https://i.imgur.com/3iQYyhS.jpg)
Shout out to Ingram with 27/7/8, his contributions are frequently overlooked imo
Zions offensive moves in the paint are insane on their own

Which makes his ball handling and playmaking ability just unfair Lol
Just another night at the office for Zanos. BEAST
Zion is a game breaker.
Ingram and Zion are so good, man. 

Adams has been a great glue guy...lots of hustle and tough rebounds. 

Lonzo with the great D.

oh Bledsoe was there too.
So you're saying Zion's really fucking good???
Zion getting me really excited about basketball
Zion/BI duo gonna be great for years to come, hopefully
People really said Zions not an all-star 😂
Zion Williamson. That is all.

BI was also great tonight with a near triple double.
Good to see Adams back. Casual double double.
And people were really saying zion shouldn't be a all star
Are we gonna talk about Josh Jackson? I know he’s kind of crazy, but holy shit dude is balling right now.
Watch Zion make an All NBA team
Is Plumlee always this good or only against the pels?
Josh Jackson actually looks quite a bit better, and I have to say Saddiq seems pretty impressive.
Zion Williamson
This Zeeon guy is pretty good. Might be able to steal a few more ASGs from Devin Booker.
You already know.

I was not the first to post it so I will concede.
nOt An aLlSTAr
How is there not one single comment about Lonzos ridiculous defense tonight
Shoutout to Steven Adams for the funniest moment of the game when he tried to do that crazy ninja getup and just fell back on the floor
Zion. damn
I genuinely hate Wayne Ellington.
This game had so many yackety sax moments it was incredible. Funniest game I’ve ever watched

Also plumblee had an insane highlight where he drove on lonzo or someone then went like behind the back across the lane and dished it backwards for an assist. Was crazy
Zion good. Excited to see how the team grows, but man Zion, BI, and Lonzo are lovely
I swear the pelicans PGTs are always at the absolute bottom of Reddit 😂
[deleted]
I appreciate it Joel Meyers going off at the end of the game that anyone complaining about Zion hasn’t actually watched him play lately
As a Suns /Pels fan I just want everyone to have a good time
His spin was nasty tn 

Ik u know which one I mean too lol

I thought u guys we’re gonna lose to us, thankfully for both of us u guys pulled through lol
And BI? Lol. He stopped growing last year.
8 assists/1 turnover... you love to see it.
On 50/50/86 as well.
I thought his floor game was really nice this game. I love that.

So close to a triple double
Tonight was the big three of Ingram Zion and Lonzo all doing exactly what they can and need to do in order to win
[deleted]
Man, every play we've gone Point Zion has been a treat this year.
>Adams has been a great glue guy...lots of hustle and tough rebounds.

And some sticky hands, too.  He was doing a great job jamming things up in the paint and creating turnovers.  And let's not forget his legendary kip-up.
nOt aN aLl StAr
I’m a defeatist that worries and panics they’re all going to demand trades
Steven and Lonzo were great too.
So there was more?
Saben Lee looked like a 10 year vet PG also. He seems like a legit starter in the league type guy
Saddiq/Josh/Saben are a solid crew for sure

Saw BI give Josh some props after the game too.
Eh, he's pretty one dimensional. Like 1 in 3 games is a really good scoring game. I think he could develop into a good 6th man.
We give up on these guys so quickly it's insane
He hasn't really seemed crazy at all since he has been with the Pistons, he does seem to have matured somewhat. He is a great weapon off the bench who can drop 20+ points any given night, but he really lacks consistency in all phases. It's wild, one play he will make a legit star-level IQ perfectly threaded bounce pass, the next play he will inexplicably throw an alley-oop pass to no one.
He’s got a pretty polished game for what many would consider and slightly above average player.
He’s been solid this year but this game he was definitely playing well

Looking like KAJ on a couple of those hooks lmao
Seriously! He had this one hook shot that left me in awe.
SVG said he was an underrated big man before the game. He def makes good reads when he plays us.
William Zionson
Glen Davis with hops
Don’t we all. Ik we’re all just hoping someone throws a 2nd at us for him lmao
Which teammate snubbed him?
I, for one, never want to see BI settle for anything but being the best. I feel like he has too much in him to not try and be a superstar. And Zion is prob good competition to play next to lol. 

They both gotta learn defense though.
Man, I was scared we were going to have another team go on a shooting record against us.

Also, Plumlee had this insane hook shot. I was in awe. Apparently we can't stop him at all.
I like that Plumlee was about to take a charge then went ['you know what---nvmd'](https://twitter.com/PelicansNBA/status/1364758646660374528)
It's like Dwight Freeney levels of footwork. He's a cheat code who's just starting to scratch the surface of what he can do and catching up to NBA speed. I really can't believe that he is matching the hype if not outpacing it. The kid is gonna be top 10 all time good if he goes to the Lebron school of longevity.
He is pretty much better in every stat this year...and the man was an all-star last year.
Yeah thats true. Dont think he's getting any taller
He's been just as good as last year. Just trying to fit with Zion and the rest of the team under a new coach
I don't understand this "he's not as good as last year" talk. He is averaging slightly more points on better efficiency. Averaging more assists while turning the ball over less and he isn't fouling nearly as much on D. 

He has improved. It's just the Isogram is not nearly as effective an offense as Point Zion.
What a bad take
It migbt be the most exciting Hornets/Pels basketball I've watched in my life

Like I absolutely loved prime CP3 and AD days but Zion is so fun to watch
That feed to JJ in transition was so sweet.
[deleted]
Ninja edited so yes
Yeah he’s an average to slightly above average C that can do a bit of everything outside of shooting.  As a backup C he’s probably the best in the league.
Wion Zilliamson
Michael Jordan with gumbo
Overweight Robert Tractor Traylor
a bigger kyrie
Why do you guys hate Ellington the Enforcer
He's saying Zion got him snubbed off the ASG roster I think
[deleted]
He was looking like Kareem on that one lmao
Lmao probably a good decision from him
And on higher difficulty shots.
[removed]
Ok I believe that, as I said to another guy I just feel like he sometimes takes bad shots and is almost selfish at times and I feel like his d isn’t as good.

I think he will make the all star team once u guys improve enough to make the playoffs but for now I view him as a near all star
Idk I’ve watched u guys quite a bit and I find ingram often is almost selfish at times, I also feel like his d isn’t as good but I didn’t watch u guys very much last year so idk where he was last year on d

I mean I could be wrong but I was just saying what I see from him, u probably watched more games than me tho
I would love to see advanced stats on our points per possession with Zion running the offense. If he doesn't go to the rim, he always seems to find the open man.
More fun than 07/08 CP3?
Imagine this team with Jrue instead of Bledsoe :crying_jordan:
He is surprisingly skilled offensively, but is just so limited defensively. No chance on the perimeter with his lack of foot speed and teams exploit that frequently.
Willion Ziamson
He’s been terrible lately 

Losing games for us, which isn’t actually that bad this year but it’s not fun to watch that when the young guys play hard every game.
This same dude thinks Ja is undeniably better than Zion based off the 8 game bubble as well.
How did Zion snub him?
Bidness decis
Spared plumlees life. What a guy
You know what the funniest part of this salt is? The country bumpkins in Oregon are more redneck than anybody in Louisiana.
You wanna get swept by some rednecks again?
Lol you gotta be a troll no way someone's this dumb
Sounds like you have some hate in your heart
You good bruh??
Every day someone new shows you how stupid they can be. You're that person today my guy
The crazy thing is he drains those bad shots pretty regularly .
I mean that is fair to say he has been selfish in the Iso sets. He has taken some awful shots from them when other guys were open. There is nothing more frustrating than watching Ingram in Isolation when he is ice cold and Zion is on the floor with him. 

He still has room to grow, but when he plays within the offense he is incredible.
His D is worse because the scheme we run this year under SVG is much more difficult to execute compared to Gentry who mostly used basic man to man. Ingram's been getting there defensively though in the past couple of games, so hoping to see that continue.

Offensively, he is definitely better. He is pulling up for 3 now more compared to last year and making them. The reason he looks worse offensively and selfish this year is because going for tough shot this year isn't as needed since we have Zion and a backcourt posting 40% from 3. Last year we could live with Ingram taking shots since our half-court sets  without JJ often ended up with Jrue or Ingram having to create something out of nothing.
Sounds crazy but he might be. Zions doing things I've never really seen before
Jrue and Steven are mutually exclusive.
Unfortunately.
Don’t get me wrong Jrue is one of my favorites to ever play but I don’t think Zion shows this much growth with Jrue still on the roster.
[deleted]
Yeah I'm definitely not sure I'd go that far. Ever been anywhere north of Alexandria?
Still salty from when we swept them
[deleted]
Ya tn he was great and has been in quite a few games but for the record I wasn’t trying to really take a shot at him, I was just saying why I feel like he isn’t mentioned much. I still view him as a near all star and I could definitely see him make it when u guys make it to the playoffs
He doesn’t even do that that much anymore, he’s our best facilitator this season and has been setting up his teammates well. It’s not like he’s calling ISO’s every other play and taking all difficult fading shots lol
Ok that makes a lot of sense

I appreciate the insightful comment, I’ll delete my original since people thought I was taking a shot at ingram
It's crazy. I know Zion is super efficient, and has amazing touch. But every game he'll have a shot or two that amazes me still.
That’s subjective, but how did Zion snub him?
Ever been anywhere outside of Portland? They put those south Arkansas fuckers to shame. Our people got an accent. But those Oregonians *act* redneck, and that’s really what matters.
Damn why you insulting Dame like that...
Np, I hate it when comments like yours get downvoted honestly. Doesn't promote discussion.
Idk man that 07-08 team was a killer. Cp3 Dwest Peja and Tyson Chandler when the CCC was a big thing. Had we not run into the monster Spurs of that time who knows what could've happened
Ya I was just thinking that. I’ve actually watched the pels quite a bit this year and thought my comment was valid but u were basically the only one who actually provided reasons why it was getting downvoted and therefore now I know more about ingram as a player

I wish more people were like u
it is astounding to me to see us be so dominate in the clutch after being historically awful for most of the last decade
Very very ugly win I think that's quite obvious but I will take it at this point considering "post ASB rust" and all that. Gordon missed like 6 or 7 of the same shot in this game. Lots of missed looks from him. 

Terry was really bad for the first 3 quarters but again came up big in the last two minutes on offense. Just crazy stuff from him man. Unbelievable clutch scorer


---

**Edit:** This is obviously something that wont be reprimanded this season, but I hope next year we improve our three point D. Its beyond laughable how many threes we allow teams to take and how many good looks they get. 29th in threes allowed and 29th in threes made against

Whether it's a personnel adjustment or schematic thing idk but I hope JB and Mitch address it.
That’s the biggest brickfest you’ll se all year. Not  just missing wide open jumpers, although there was plenty of that. But an INSANE amount of point blank floaters and layups missed by both teams
[TERRY ROZIER CONTINUES TO INDUCE FEAR IN OPPONENTS AND THE HORNETS FINALLY REACH .500 LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO](https://youtu.be/XOdfm1ZGLuk)

Yeah his name is Terry, and yeah he ain't big but boy he's so scary. Game got a little hairy but he put the team on his back, FULL CARRY 🎒 🎒 🎒
National writers can stfu about swapping Terry for Lonzo please lmao
Bruh how’d the ending last so long & how are the Hornets .500 again
Is Terry Time a thing now??
THANOS TEAM ONCE AGAIN
I mean you must be a really bad team to lose to Detroit this season
MJ gonna make sure his team beats the pistons every time.
I will ride the high of that Stewart 3 for several days.
The spread was -4.5.  

Charlotte up 5 with 9 seconds left.  

Two freethrows for detroit with 1 second left in the game.  

Charlotte wins by 3.

Lol
Rozier with his best MJ impression
I dont get how Svi was in that entire end of the game getting cooked, but then when the Pistons actually need a 3 he's on the bench.
I'm happy to lose but it still pisses me off that Charlotte keeps winning nailbiter games against us, and still jumped us last year to draft Lamelo.

We're gonna riot if we don't get Cade or Jalen.
As much as I love Kemba, Imma tale Scarence in the last two minutes.
Terry is the truth.
Frightening Terrance.
Bey would have been the perfect pick for us, no offense Toppin.
Beating a team by shooting 38% & 7-25 from three? Sheesh.
Melo  making his first playoff in his rookie year would look so good for his bbb stocks
God damn, did you see the way Lamelo used Rozier’s body to hit those last two shots? Incredible from the ROY
That was mostly overreliance on Kemba and Clifford being really bad in late game situations. The year Borrego came in we immediately improved to league average even with Kemba on the squad
I still instinctively cringe whenever we have to inboards the ball late in games.

Then I remember Steve Clifford isn’t our coach any more.
kemba walker effect
Terry saw MJ in the house and thought he needs to make up for the first 3 quarters so they don’t trade him lol keep Terry here!
Gordon has been pretty meh since the end of January. My fear is that he will struggle hard in the playoffs when defenses tighten up since his game relies so heavily on bumping around his man and trying to force space to open. We need our guards to maintain this crazy high level of play since he just really can't run the offense
crazy clutch last 5 minutes from Terry
I swear to god Tom Brady must have deflated those balls.
Lots of terrible turnovers in the first half as well. Teams were just rusty from the break, it tightened up later.
I'd still do it tbh
i don't know but I'm loving it
Oddly enough, the hornets had the same record through 36 games 2 years ago

2021 18-18

2020 13-23

2019 18-18
A whole new meaning of T time
Yes
You must be really bad to beat Detroit this season
Imagine losing to them, Like the nets did last month
Beef stew raining those seasoned threes. Scared me so much
That was epic lmao I was so mad
Them boys (odds makers) good
Thank God I went with the moneyline lol
😭I really needed hornets to cover to... I’m presswd
I'm not crying you're crying
Melon > Ja
I think he got pretty good looks tonight, shots just didn’t fall. I’m a lot more confident that his game can continue to be effective as long as he’s healthy
I'd have to agree with you there. Been pretty subpar for some weeks imo

He was stellar in the playoffs for Utah the season before he left so idk what to think. He's gotta get his shots to fall
That's goober material
considering Terry is more consistent I'm afraid I wont
Absolutely not. If terry is traded, it better be for a center. We don’t need guards right now.
Great job you found the joke
Terry is not what I would call a consistent player lol. Also we would instantly have the tallest backcourt in the nba and be switchable 1-4
if you compare him to Lonzo he's consistent lol
I still don't understand how Westbrook pulls down 19 rebounds a game
Hachimura with a +23. Incredible from the young lad.
The fact we almost blew a 30 point lead to the Pistons is sad.
Rui came up clutch. Definitely the future of the Wiz if he keeps developing.
Why is it a picture of Zion lol. 

Edit: nvm it’s like that for all the games
Russ is averaging a triple double again :)
T A N K W A R S
Didnt watch, was Gafford good as his box reads cuz if he can rim run and block wizards are immediately much better than before.
traded troy brown jr for jerome robinson to go 0-5 on rotation minutes only to play a little short.. rough
The Pistons’ roster is an embarrassment.
[deleted]
Hes stealing rebounds bro its easy anyone can do it
Here's the video- https://www.nba.com/stats/events/?ContextMeasure=DREB&EndPeriod=0&EndRange=28800&GameID=0022000694&PlayerID=201566&RangeType=0&Season=2020-21&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&StartPeriod=0&StartRange=0&TeamID=1610612764&flag=1&sct=plot&section=game
Rui’s going to be a star, I said it first.
Imagine doing that.....
It's always some random photo that reddit randomly grabs from the stat site that day. At least I'm pretty sure that's what's happening. Sometimes they're hilarious without context
I still think you can make a push for the play in if things go right, it's not impossible
He played really well but Brooks likes to have a 3 center reason for some stupid ass reason so he only got limited playing time. Looks like the best of the 3 tho
Yup
Moses would agree
I would guess it's a low efficiency game leading to more bricks but he looked pretty good offensively today.
I said it in his rookie season
Just need another mini win streak and they're back in
we are the best team in the nba
Sabonis did nice work today. 8 assists, 3 steals and 2 blocks. And shy 26 points.
They got off to what
Stew and Josh Jackson😤
Schneid
Beef Stew did great in his first start
the pistons have deemed the pacers pretenders.
Hopefully DSJ gets more brun
Glad to have snapped a 4-game losing streak fuck
how did dsj look?
I hate Dennis Smith Jr. He is so absolutely garbage. He's fast but gets blown by constantly, he makes dumb shot choices, he isn't a smart ball handler, there's nothing good about his game. I wish we would have just let Rose walk
blake's stat lines are sad
Pistons are a real embarrassment to the league. Washed-up Blake G and a bunch of trash.
Ur not a contender if you don't lose to the pistons tho
In normal circumstances I'd prefer losing to the Pistons to prove we are legit

But now I'm just so tired of losing I don't care who we beat
# S C H N E I D
You know not of the schneid in Minnesota? Really?

Okay, well, [here ya go](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/where-does-get-off-the-schneid-come-from-history) (said in a bad fake accent, doncha know)
Like a guy that has barely seen the court in a year & had 1 practice with his new team. It’ll take some time to shake the rust off, he was pretty passive
Wasn't assertive, didn't look good.

But given the limited time to learn the system and get thrown in the lineup, I am fine with it. He was just deferring to the hot hands on the team.
You got a future 2nd rounder too though. How is that worse than free?
> I wish we would have just let Rose walk

We made the trade for a 2nd round pick, and Smith is a FA after this year anyway. Would have been dumb to let Rose for nothing.
Cry about it
Fade em
Ah shit
tell em!
pain
This was a lovely TIL. Thanks for sharing
Because he's so bad and it wasn't even our own 2nd.
There's a good chance we trade the 2nd rounder and let Smith go. So basically we did trade him for nothing
This game was simultaneously not as close and much closer than this score indicates
We’re not contenders we can’t even lose to the Pistons smh
I love Royce
#Mountain Mike Conley is an All-Star
Let's agree that this game never happened.
We almost choked that game.
Credit to the Pistons, they play hard and were great in the 2nd half after being down by as many as 28 late in the first half. They turned a massive blowout into a nail-biter down the stretch before Utah ended the game on an 8-0 run. Hell of an effort
It was ugly, but we're number one in the West baby!!
after all of that the spread pushes. Wow. lol

edit: Jazz lead by 28 in the 2nd q and 27 in the 3rd. Pistons cut it to 4 with under 2 min left and Utah finished the game on a 8-0 run
That was a game that happened.  

Best record in the league though!  Cheers, Brooklyn.
If for some reason we didn't have Favs right now, i'd totally be okay with Plumlee, the man seems like he is just pure energy every time we play him
Shit got serious for a second there
I’m more shocked to hear my team actually came within 4 cause i stopped paying attention about midway through the 2nd quarter.

I like that we’ve shown fight, but we need to get out rookies more play and stop playing the vets so much if we’re tanking anyway.

Also confused on why Rose didn’t play even though he was listed as in tonight. Unless... a trade
Jazz did their best to blow this game. Glad Bogey showed up to put it away late.
Detroit looked solid.  Scrappy gritty defense, and Grant seemed to score or assist every possession 2nd half.

How are they 5-16?  They looked much better than that.
2nd half was ugly
Shoutout to Dwayne fucking Casey for putting Blake to make sure we lose this game

Shoutout to Delon Wright, for missing a easy wide open 3, then stutter back on defense, zero effort, then Bog ended the game

Well, we still tanking while still competitive, unfortunately, Dwayne Casey does not want to let the rookies play on a team that is rebuilding
The Pistons almost didn't show up for the beginning of the game and the Jazz almost didn't show up for the end. Its like poetry, it rhymes
Did anyone else see the Jazz run the UCLA 1 4 offence a few times and get easy lay ups?
That was a game of basketball between the Utah Jazz and the Detroit Pistons.
Bogey shoot good.
#FreePlumlee
The Nuggets loss was just a dip. Now we buy Jazz stonks and ride to the moon
And so, another winning streak starts
It's always nice to go in a thread like this and observe that even the best team in the league has shit to stress about and try to fix.
Plumdog Billionaire tonight with the 17 and 14.
[deleted]
It was much closer. We probably would have lost if Bogey didn’t ice those last two threes.
Things went much better once you got so far ahead that you kind of lost interest.
it was butthole clenching for a period of time
You're very close on both tonight.
He is so essential to the Jazz's success
Jazz haven’t played Detroit yet this season as far as I’m concerned
It’s nice that we can close out games though. Feels like the past couple years we would’ve blown it, this year we’re overcoming huge deficits anf hanging onto nailbiters like this.
eh. Without playing so well in the first 2.5 quarters we lose going away. On top of that we missed a bunch of really good open looks in the last 5 mins. Given our sample size track record that doesnt bother me
Then we're right up there with the rest of the West contenders!
*league
Plumlee is fucking great.
Oh okay then. Plumlee for Mitchell straight up no questions asked
Stomach issues.

https://mobile.twitter.com/JLEdwardsIII/status/1356841059263909889?s=20
Bc we have Griffin playing 30 minutes per night, and Dwayne Casey as our coach

Your Young Core is all right, but our vets sucks so much
Because their team is shit
Yeah idk why he went to him late. Jerami was carving us up all night, and suddenly takes the ball out of his hands.
They've been doing that for the better part of like, 30 years too!
hey everyone, the Box Score Nephew has chimed in!
Delon Wright and Blake Griffin helped too
Had some ptsd from our shooting slump losses in the past three seasons. Bogey hitting both those just did a lot for confidence.
He looks like a new offensive player this year. He doesn't second guess scoring opportunities he just takes it and has made some great moves around the basket.
*My heart
In Casey mind, crunch time is perfect for Griffin post-up
One possession the wings cut to the basket and got open and another the elbows set picks for the wings. It was beautiful.
Just like old times!
Bruh anyone else just hear Klay absolutely roast Rodney McGruder
Reporter Klay all day
Wiggins with a team high +28

You love to see it
Steph finally above 40% on 3P%
 Everybody into the water. It's a Poole party
Warriors the only team this season to beat the Pistons by more than 15
The Warriors got a good pick AND a better player from the wolves lmao. Wolves need to completely clean house
This blowout was worth watching just for reporter Klay.
Stewart looked incredible tonight
Steph fucking up the sky again. Wiseman dunking on everybody. Wiggy and Oubre playin crucial roles. Draymond with a Draymond statline. Klay the reporter. Warriors blowing out another team. WHAT IS THIS TIMELINE I LOVE IT
I’ve read about Blake Griffin coasting, but that’s the first time I’ve watched it. Dude looked inconvenienced to be out there.
klay talkin bout rodney mcgruder bein out of the league soon LMAO
Klay clowning McGruder postgame lol
Klay taking shots at Rodney Mcgruder lol
Steph > Ellington
Legit don't understand this Warriors team. Their average point differential is like -2 which suggests a lot of close losses but the point differential in their last few games: +27, -21, +12, +22, -19, -15, +22... And it keeps going! Their games are always blowouts and it's just a matter of which team is on the receiving end of the blow out.
Damn the Wayne Ellington hype train went off the rails tonight. Just a really bad night guy couldn't buy a bucket.
Klay thompson is roasting the shit out of Rodney McGruder I'm so hurt rn
Yeee we looking good now. Playoffs, here we come!
MVP of the game: Klay Thompson on commentary
Jordan Poole the goat of garbage time
That postgame interview was amazing lol
What the hell happened to the pistons that destroyed my Lakers? Blake? Hello? D.rose?? Plumlee playing like Ben Wallace? What happened?
Hmm Glad too see that Blake is back to his usual self
McGruder: 0 
Klay: 1 
Savage Klay: Our hearts
Blake so washed he should be cleaning cars
Anybody hear Klay's trash talking at the end 🤣
Lol mullin in the post game “klay is in a good headspace”
DUBS GET THE DUB
Curry can’t carry a team like Westbrook though 🥴
Stew had a good game and that's about it, fade for cade
Lmaooo Klay really said that Mcgruder’s gonna be out of the league soon
If you missed Klay interviewing Steph post game, go find it.
Klay took off on Rodney McGruder lmao
We need more Reporter Klay
Klay in the booth and postgame made this extremely entertaining
Griffin barely looked like an NBA player out there tonight
who the fuck is McGruder and why the fuck did he get his panties in a bunch while playing 2 mins lol smh
Say what you want, but McGruber had a team high +6 in 6 minutes, and diffused 2 bombs.
Draymond Green really mastered getting triple single every night, he was in double digits 4x this season, 2x in points and 2x in assists
WE MAY NEVER LOSE AGAIN ^^^tonite
LMAO that interview
This game was amazing. Best part was 3rd quarter reporter Klay and the burn at the end.
Most interesting thing about this game was the Klay postgame interview
Reporter Klay with Steph has to be the greatest post game interview of all time
Wayne Ellington didn't hit a 3. Didn't score a single point. Yall can go ahead and shut that shit up.
Doumbouya look like Greta?
Everyone talking about Klay trashign Mcgruder, thats how you know how this game went
The pistons shot 38 percent? Jesus that's bad.
Bum ass Rodney with 8 points

"this dude gonna be out the league soon, he's probably mad about that...over here, tryna start somethin like he s a good player!"

i'm dead!
Can’t take shots during the game so he’s gotta get em in after
man RIP McGruder, Klay just ruthlessly ether’d him in the booth

hahahah dudes a legend! Love it!
That was absolutely unreal my gosh klay lmao

FATALITY
Aw man I missed the end of the game. What happened?
lmfao, he just said "this dude gonna be out the league soon, he's probably mad about that" about Rodney McGruder post-game

e: "over here, tryna start somethin like he
s a good player!"  

i'm dead!
That interview post of Steph that Klay gave was amazing
[Reporter Klay](https://imgur.com/K7j6t6g)
Want to see his notes on our commentators!
Two way Wiggs
Klay roasting McGruber

you hate to see it
"Just you wait..." - Twolves fans
I still see Steph at 39.5% on the ESPN, NBA, and Basketball Reference sites:

https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3975/stephen-curry

https://www.nba.com/stats/player/201939/

https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/curryst01.html

Edit: I wasn't doubting u/girthymf -- I was simply pointing out that those sites hadn't updated yet at the time of my comment.
We beat them by 37 (combined)
we wouldn't even trade them back wiggins for d lo straight up 🤣🤣🤣
They needed to trade Andrew though. KAT wanted him gone and they could only get DLO in return because of the contract situation, plus he's friends with KAT. Minnesota had their hands tied.
Yeah, but not for that trade so much as for letting it get to the point where they *had* to make that trade.
I think freeing up airtime for Klay was the sole reason we put it out of reach so early.

Light years
Yeah he did. Klay said something about a move wiseman tried on Stewart and said something like “well he’s only 19 and it’s gonna take a while to do that against nba defense.” When they told him Stew was also 19 he was really impressed. That dude is built as fuck for a teenager.
He looked pretty good last time we played as well
That’s awesome, got to see Stewart a few times in college last year and it seemed like he could either be really solid or lack the ability to make an impact, happy to see it’s the former.

I walked past the dude as I was entering one of my classes last year, HOLY FUCK is that a big man.
I really want a Klay/Chris broadcast for just one game lol
I mean outside of a couple games he’s been pretty bad. Wouldn’t say it’s coasting as much as he’s declined and in the tail end of his career
Yeah with all the injuries he’s had hes more or less done unless he can somehow transform his game one last time.
He had a horrendous 1st quarter. I can't believe how many possessions end with a missed shot off a Blake post up.
At first I thought he went over there cause maybe he had a homie on the GSW side. Tf was he mad about?
https://streamable.com/scgsmg
That was amazing. More reporter Klay please
i mean lets see what Steph can do with a larger sample size. Ellington has established himself as the GOAT shooter
It’s because the Warriors basically have two different games: ones where people make their threes at which point the motion offense and their defense mean they can beat anybody, or the ones where they don’t make their threes which mean their offense grinds to a halt and their lack of rebounding kills them because they can’t get any second chance points from all their bricks.
As they say, go big or go home
Average point differential doesn't suggest close losses. If the standard deviation was low you might say that.
Azibuke Curse
They also just zoomed in on Delon when talking about Wayne on csn bay area

Hoping for 4th seed; we're 0.5 games out.

Want to see the whole panel on Inside the NBA choke on it as they said last week (unanimously)  we "would miss the playoffs"
shit weve taken care of the pistons twice and beaten yall, i think the dubs are just on a different tier than those two other teams this year man 

NOT /S LETSGO
D Rose had nothing to offer either
Dude tried to repeatedly post up from deep against zone defense not pass, then complain he didn’t get a foul call when he turned it over.
https://streamable.com/scgsmg
It's true! Where were these Pistons two days ago?
i could listen to that commentary for the rest of the season
This was on a par with his 37 point quarter!

lmfao, he just threw in the headset and up and left the Steph postgame interview!
And Draymond went story of Adidon on him
This man did not care haha

*have to
Today’s stats don’t show until tomorrow
nba.stats link above just updated. He’s at 40.8% now
Minnesota had their hands tied cuz they completely squandered their assets in that horrible Butler trade. Their better off retooling completely and trading Towns before his value tanks after a trade request. They could probably get a huge haul from the Thunder.
KATs wanted a lot of things: being the leader over JB, Saunders over Thibs, Wigs gone, his best bud DLo in, hell he’s even got his old guy Rubio back...
 
if he can’t drag them into the play-in after he gets back, r/NBA isn’t gonna hear the end of it. cus they’re 5 games behind and only 18 games in, so it isn’t like we don’t have plenty of season left...
>they could only get DLO in return

KAT wanted d'lo
That’s Beef Stew for ya
Chris Mullen?
Chriss?
I guess, my sample size is one game, it just appeared as lack of interest rather than physical decline. I swear there was a series where he stood at half court on both offense and defense.
he was limping around the court, had no place there to be honest
This is a good take. I’ve been trying to figure this out and wasn’t sure. You have really clarified this. When I watch the Warriors now, I’m going to start predicting the outcome of the games with this insight and see how it ends up.
It actually does, because a team that blows out some teams typically doesn't get blown out by other teams to the point where the avg. point differential is really small.

Statistically, you're correct, but there is somewhat of a logical correlation.
Kelenna Kurse
omg thank you, I was like, "I don't remember Ellington looking like that."
That was embarrasing lol
If you guys actually end up with the 4th seed, curry absolutely needs to win mvp
Lmao so true
That does sound a lot like his Clipper days lol.
Better wait for NBA sign a contract with Twitch for that to happen. I need a Charles Barkley, ODPixel and Kevin Garnett commentary
Minnesota got a 1st and Beasley/Juancho/Vanderbilt for Covington.

Rockets got 2 firsts and Ariza when they traded RoCo, then they swapped one of the firsts, a 2027 2nd rounder, and Ariza for Christian Wood, a first round pick, and a Detroit 2021 second round pick that looks like it'll be the 31st pick in the draft.

Not only did they mess up the Butler trade, somehow the Rockets made out like bandits with what they got for Roco comparatively.
Whats a realistic trade package for towns? Im not even sure how you can quantify him. Hes the best shooting center. Thats fuckin valuable
I think KAT is the player the most excuses are made for in the league. In isolation his game is fantastic, but this his what, 6th? Year in the league and he’s contributed to winning basketball once (I give him almost as much credit as Jimmy for that year, people say they fell from 3rd to 8th without jimmy, but they were like 3 games ahead, and missing your best player for 25 games does that. He also wasn’t worse than jimmy in those playoffs). But outside of that single year, when has he gotten enough shit done to be mentioned as a top 4 big in the league with Joel, Jokic and AD? His counting numbers are fantastic, but they just don’t win, and the wolves on paper never were as bad as they end up being. They lost a 17 point lead with like 2 minutes to go last year, which he played in. First time in 8500 of such instances. You think Embiid, Jokic or AD would’ve gotten a pass for that?
Well KAT had a hard year. I think he'll be fine.
Trust me I want him benched/traded but o doubt either is happening for whatever reason
It's gonna go to embiid and that's absolutely reasonable.
Klay and draymond best be on there too for some guest interviews. dudes are hilarious
The first round pick in the Wood sign and trade is heavily protected, and the second is the Lakers which is practically useless
First of all, I should probably mention that pretty much everyone has AD, Embiid, and Jokic over KAT, so if your complaining about him being considered a top 4 big you should be talking about Adebayo, Gobert, etc.... But also the reason they aren’t winning games isn’t KAT’s fault, it’s because they are a horribly coached and managed franchise. Your talking about how they’re better on paper but when KAT and DLo have been taking turns being injured idk how true that is. And ultimately bad coaching can absolutely hold back talent on the court.
The pick is heavily protected to a point it actually messes up the Piston's flexibility long term as they get Stepian ruled like every year indefinitely.
Also I assume wood wanted to come to the rockets anyway but they probably couldn't make it happen salary wise without a sign and trade.
Oh for sure it’s not just KAT. I think this is the first season that people aren’t putting him in that category, I remember getting into arguments last season saying that both Embiid and Jokic were better than KAT.

I mean the injuries suck, but even in the Wiggins years they should’ve been a lot better than they were, coaching and roster construction be damned. Last season KAT didn’t win a single game for an 11 game stretch, whereas the wolves won a few in between when he was out.

I’m not saying KAT isn’t good, I’m saying other ‘stars’ would get roasted if they lost 11 straight.
Part of the reason he doesn’t get roasted more is because people don’t care about the timberwolves and the few that do know how incompetent the franchise is. Even then he does get a fair amount of criticism for his defense and being “soft”.
Watching Blake try to hobble around a basketball court is honestly depressing and I don’t even like him very much.
Jerami Grant deserves some respect.
Can someone please lose to Detroit?

If their only win on the season is against us I'll be mad
Grant really said, “Fuck Denver, I want to be the man”
Nwora is a lights out shooter. Bobby and Thanasis are the next superstar duo.
Saddiq Bey is the steal of the draft. Looks like a future 10+ year NBA starter on the wing.
The Blazers traded two firsts for Robert Covington when they could’ve just drafted Saddiq Bey, who’s basically Robert Covington Jr.
So how washed up did Blake look in this game
Donte was really cold, his worst game of the season.  Jrue also with one of his worst games, although he has been pretty consistently positive this season.

Middleton looked pretty impressive.  Portis played super well (especially considering he mostly played without Giannis on the court, contributed to why his plus/minus looks bad, he was playing with the bench guys).

Defense struggled with Thanasis out there, but I don't think that was Thanasis's fault.  I think he actually played pretty well, got his four dunks, one really nice pass.

Bucks should have subbed out Giannis earlier in fourth when things got so chippy.
damn Bey with 20/10
Thanasis sure is getting a lot of minutes this year, and not just in garbage time
1 win against the celtics and bottom of the entire league? Good year for the pistons
Giannis is a monster. And only in 28 minutes as well! Wow.
Blake is done. I can't believe I'm typing this... I'm honestly very sad.
How many years does Blake have on his current contract including this season?
The Bucks continue to have the best point differential in the East and are the best team in the East. If anything their record undersells their performance thus far.
that was certainly a basketball game
What happened with Giannis and Stewart?
Detroit fans must be used to seeing Wisconsin teams beat them by now
Why did Rose only play 11 minutes?
What kind of mess has Troy Weaver created...

Sheesh
He's an asshole, this is karma
I really want the Jerami Grant MIP narrative to gain some traction
I’m still pissed u guys ruined our perfect year
At 23/5/2 he kind of is the man there
He's going to be awesome for whatever playoff team trades a late first for him at the deadline in 2 years.
Looks he was right to do so. Said goodbye to the playoffs but hello to a brighter future.
A great article was posted on the Athletic today about how the fact that we have a black coach and black GM was also a contributing factor into his decision
Guys he had 10 rebounds not 9 are the stats wrong?
Yeah he's justifying that contract for sure although the roster construction is still trash
i respect it
I just love watching Thanos pumping his fist for every tiniest accomplishment. 30 points ahead and he wins an offensive foul? Time to party!
On a scale of Carmelo to Ariza, Blake is Shaq on the Cavs.
Completely washed up
It was painful.. you can’t even get mad at his foul baiting. It’s al he has left
He's still savvy as hell despite his current limited mobility.
I think you should give Jrue credit for his assists and rebounds, at least. His shots weren't falling but he wasn't totally ineffective out there.

Donte had a rough one but I'm not worried about it.
Craig's minutes.
He had 16 points in the first quarter. This was a very average game for him.
This year and a Player option next year
Playing the pistons twice helps a lot....
Yeah, Milwaukee's team has changed a lot but I think the guys they picked up have a lot of potential and hunger to prove themselves whereas the vets they lost sort of lacked some of that fire. Bucks may actually surprise some people this year who have underrated the new pick ups.

Caveat being that they just played Detroit twice in a row and Chicago before that so there's been plenty of opportunity for guys to show out.
Stewart was playing D a little harder than you'd expect a rookie to play against Giannis. He did say he watched a documentary on the 04 pistons, so i'm not surprised.
Stewart is a hard working physical player and he boxed out Giannis to the ground 1 play and another pretty hard foul another play

I don’t think Giannis appreciated that
Injured
um idk how he created anything bad, all the bad shit was what svg and the clown show left him
It's the bucks? Their average margin of victory against other teams was close to 40 points. We lost by 8 and 15(deceptively close it was much worse but down our 2 PGs). I'll take it
And a 1-7 record lol
It was a good choice, he secured the bag and he’s been really good
the generator is sometimes behind so a couple of stats might be missing
He is the hype.
that bad eh?

Does he even have value as an expiring next season?
I’m kind of trying to find footage since I didn’t watch the game 

Can’t believe it’s that bad
Yeah, Jrue pretty much always seems to have a positive impact cause he has such a balanced game.  He honestly has been really effective so far despite being really low usage.  So one of Jrue's worst game is still a pretty good game.
He is still a monster. 16 points first quarter! Get outta here
Damn so he’s basically untradeable and there’s no reason for him to agree to a buyout.. lol fck
Well you beat other teams by ~40 so I actually feel pretty good about our losses lol
And you get us again in like four days.
Not really compared to your other wins.
As a Milwaukee fan ... keep up the good work, kid.

Don't ever let anyone intimidate you.
I wanted to joke about it, but I can't even. if Blake elects to take his player option rather than retire, Detroit literally has $0 in cap space next year.
He had the same bag offered to him in Denver, so the money is a wash. The difference is (presumably) being on a contender in Denver but a role player vs. being a first option on a non-contender.

It hurt our team, so that sucks for us, but he didn't owe us anything as a free agent; he didn't tank his value for a trade or something like that (which also could have happened had he convinced himself of something and then realized down the line what he really wanted was what he is getting now in DET).

I will never blame a man for betting on himself. Hope he does well for himself (just so long as he doesn't beat the Nuggets whenever we play him).
Probably not unless he improves or we take back a bad contract
He's so ineffective I would rather he not play at all. Over 60% of his shots on the year are 3 pointers and he's no sniper, so all he does is step back threes, or pass to other players behind the line. On defense, he obviously can't move so any move at all he just gives up and let's the guy past pretty much.
https://youtu.be/1cX7mO_uCJ4

1st qtr highlights for you. I’m sure the rest of the game will come out soon
I don't think he'll be this bad all season.
Being a first option on a non-contender and performing to a high level also means you can secure bigger bags in the future
Jerami really just preferred DET over DEN. He's recently said that he wanted to join an organization that had a black GM and a black coach and was also in a black-majority city. He wasn't getting that in Denver.
Y’all offered him the exact same deal in length? Or just the exact same annual salary for a shorter length?
Me neither , but i just want him to win a ring
There's two ways to read this.
Nuggets offered him the exact same contract. 60/3 just like Detroit. Detroit offered it first and Denver matched, Jerami still left
Oh, I see what you were saying with the buyout. I don't think he's quite at buyout level yet. I think he'll get back up to speed and start playing good ball again. His instincts and savviness are still there.
I thought this game was played this morning and I somehow missed it
Apparently noone posted this so here it is
Damn that must have been a long game
I thought there was legit a game at 9am lol. Vucevic and Fournier are really good. I don’t think the magic would have made much noise but they’re definitely a good nba team, just got crushed by injuries.
A game totally happened.
One of the most prolific games of this generation
tHe ReFs sUck! ToTalLy rUinEd tHis gAme


- PGT staple
Damn, why was this game played so early?
[deleted]
Wow
Why was there game this early
Would love to watch some nba before work.

Maybe they can schedule the worst teams in the breakfast time slot to discourage teams from tanking, because players would be pissed having to play this early lol
You need to post the box score my guy, not just the link
Magic-Pistons is the new Lightning-Blue Jackets
The game wasn’t as close as the score indicates^TM
He was garbage offensively, although he did hit back to back 3s. He was good defensively. Has been for the past 2 or 3 games. He still looks outta shape. Hopefully he improves.
He's bad. He gambles for steals and our fans think that means good defense.
You know how to do that?
The box score generator should have it
Yeah this game currently isn't available on it
Just copy paste this

Got it, thanks man
clutch
Btw you can also view yesterday's games on the box score generator. There is a tab on top of the page
led by clint capelas WHAT
Excuse me, Clint, but what the fuck
What an awesome win. That’s huge, especially with so many players outs tonight. 

Starting 5 were responsible for 119 of the 123 points we scored
Disappointed that nobody has posted the highlight of Blake's and-1 late in the fourth.

Yeah, I know I should do it, but I don't know how.
Capela with 27 points, 26 rebounds, **12 offensive rebounds** and 5 blocks. He's averaging 25 points and 18.7 rebounds over his last 3 games and deserves serious all-star consideration
Winning with 4 pts from the bench while missing Hunter, Reddish, Bogdonovic, and Gallinari was not something I expected. Also love it when someone covers the line in OT.
Capela and Sexton own the night. Trae also came outta nowhere with this one. John Collins with the block that made my boy Bam even shed a tear. LOVE TO SEE IT
CAPELA WENT NUCLEAR
Was waiting for this to get posted.... SAY HIS NAME
4 points from the bench DONT FORGET THAT
[The true face of a killer](https://i.imgur.com/33nwA1F.png)
The Hawks spent all that money in free agency only for them to all get injured and windup with one of the worst rotations in basketball once again
This was the best eastern conference OT game involving a player named Collin dropping 30+ pts tonight
Ugly win but proud of John Trae and Clint for fighting back. We had no bogi, Gallo, reddish or Hunter so we had no wings to play. I thought we were done for in the first half but credit to those 3 they carried us over the line
our bench scored 4 points and we still won😂
Capela woke up and chose violence
Clint Capela.

We fleeced Houston.
Clint "Wilt Chamberlain" Capela
Clint Capela

Choke job by Detroit
ALL HAIL TRAVIS SCHLENK FOR FINESSING THE ROCKETS
I hope Trae is back.
IM SO GLAD I HAVE CLINT CAPELA IN FANTASY
Look everyone! The r/nba virgins in their natural habitat... judging Trae for his FT stats cause they can read a box score but can’t actually watch a game to form an accurate opinion
> 27 PTS and 26 REBs

That's a man-among-boys statline
BRO WHAT THE FUCK LMAO?
holy shit 26 rebounds
4 points from the bench was less than optimal. Really need to get healthy. Dudes showed great mentality to come back
Capela is the best non-star center.

He’s right under the tier with Bam, AD,Jokic, KAT and Embiid
Guys out there showed a lot of heart.

This is one that they can feel good about after trailing by 17 midway through the 4th.
FUCK THE TRAE HATERS
If the Hawks play their cards right, they could make a run at the championship by 2025
Capela trade deadline tasty. Do the Hawks need Collins and CLint?
Pistons choked so hard. Horrible shot selection in the last 3 mins and overtime. This teams half court offense consists of errant Jeremi Grant shots, Blake griffin attempting to post someone up and flailing, and Derrick rose trying to be Derrick rose of 2010 and failing horribly. Add in mason plumlee being a complete bonehead and these are your 2021 pistons. Sad.
baby come back
Lol wtf was that
damn capela
I still think the Rockets should have kept Capela, But hey, what do I know
Trae Young had a big game! Checks box score and sees 19 free throws... that explains it
Grant had 32?

Man Wood needs that MIP
Hawks had 38 fta. Lmao
Capela to Celtics c'mon Danny make it happen
led by clint capela’s 👀
Now thats some roast beef
Didn't even mention the 5 blocks
That’s what happens when your opposing big men are Plumlee and Griffin
That's gourmet
i wanted to start crying when he hit that lmao. it was insane
I thought that was gonna be the dagger tbh
If you download OBS, what people use for streaming video games, you can upload clips to streamable in under a minute. One of the guys on /r/atlantahawks was so good at it he could get clips up in under 10s after the play happened.
Capela is a damn tank and I love it. Mega-Schroeder is very good
This timeline is getting weirder and weirder...
Clint Capela, Jarrett Allen, Andre Drummond, Nikola Vucevic

How would you rank those players
Man had this copy and pasted ready to go lol
lol the whole nba gonna implode if Clint Capela makes an all star team
I have been a massive Clint capela fan since he was drafted, always thought he could make an all defensive team or even dpoy at his ceiling
One of those games was against the Micro Wolves. 50 year old Shaq could put up 20/20 against us lol.
And Dunn still hasn't sniffed the court. We are in such a bad spot injury wise. I know Detroit isn't good, but I still can't believe we won.
I forgot all about gallo and bogdonovic being on the team
You should expect to best Detroit no matter who you have playing.
It makes me so sad how true you saying "Trae also came outta nowhere with this one" is. I hope this is the start of him finally coming out of his slump.
..You're Hawkenberg
Sent chills down my spine
Lmao he looks like an old man. Honestly if he shaved his head and shaved his goatee to where he only had a mustache, he’d kinda look like waluigi.
Wow now I know who tray reminds me of. Takashi69or whatever that dude who snitched is. Looks wise.
>Vucevic 

Lmao. This needs to be posted on every thread when we win.
Solomon Hill has played the most minutes of our off-season acquisitions lol
We were missing two starters in Hunter and Reddish too, not exactly our normal team out there
4 points from the bench... I'm curious how often that happens.
I mean, last year we were saying all we needed was a playable center, so I guess that’s kind of a thing here
Collin(s)
Swiss guy neutral no longer
eh not really, he was injured for the year and HOU only center was IH so we switched to small ball. It ended up turning into Christian Wood. Wood > Cli(n)t
John wants a Max contract, Hawks can't afford to pay him that at same time Deandre Hunter is having a improve year averaging near 17 pgg. So Between Trae, Clint, gallinari, Hunter and Hawks other young wings, you can see were this get complicated.
They put up a fight every night. Can’t wait til you guys get some more guys to surround ur core. Such a fun team to watch man
Same, but you move your goalpost with these feelings. even when Atlanta was on the 10 year playoff run before the rebuild it was us always losing in the 2nd round. We knew we had no business contending past that. If you don't make the playoffs people will say you suck, then if you do and can't win people will say its pointless.

Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl loss too, and the worst part... I'm an Arsenal fan.

Both of us will never know what its like to be a Lakers or Celtics fan and actually win.
They legit took the worst shots possible from the 4th quarter on. Just contested shots early in the shot clock possession after possession
quality loss
If you watch the game the opinion doesn’t change.
Vuc > Capela imo
So you think he's better than Rudy Gobert?
Over Christian Wood bro?
19 FTA... wait for the next wave of anti-Young.
Offensively they can be a bit rough together but they work really well together defensively.
They dont have another center yet
He was injured and would have been out for months including the start of the playoffs if the season didn’t get suspended
Embiid took 22 free throws in his game against the celtics
Yeah but if you actually watch the game you see they are legit and the refs also aren't giving him the old calls. I think its a huge symptom of r/NBA. They just ride narratives. It seems like the refs went on a strike to not give him the old calls.
Your username is a Big part of the reason
his big dangling BALLS
Here at no dunks, we love big beef!
team finally plays with some heart and that could’ve ended it all
Giga-Schroeder
Lmao Mega-Schroeder
The final Pokémon evolution of Schroeder
That’s great lmao. He should embrace that name. Every time he dunks or catches a lob the PA guy should scream *”MEGA-SCHROEDER”* in a distorted robot voice.
Vucevic has to be the one of the most underrated players in the league. That mofo can **shoot**
Not the guy you replied to, but Vucevic, Capela, Drummond, Allen - with the strong caveat that Allen is on a trajectory to surpass Drummond soon.
Capela

Allen

Vuc

Drummond
We just need to hover around .500 and we should be fine. This team is extremely talented and I do think at full strength we would be good enough to avoid the play-in, but right now we just need to stay around our current record and we should be good.
Detroit’s beat some good teams this year
Yea man, it’s been tough to watch. He’ll get back to it tho. If fucking Kendrick Nunn can get his groove back literally anyone can. Also, tonight was a great start
Deadass looks like hector salamanca lmfao
I still don't believe we actually signed Solomon Hill he just kind of snuck up in to the practice facility and wrote his name on the roster sheet and we all just kind of roll with it
Nah man, Wood could’ve easily played next to Clint like John is right now. John and Wood are basically the same player. John and Clint have one of the highest plus minus of a duo in the entire league
[deleted]
[deleted]
Also the braves blowing their 3-1 lead against the dodgers this past year.
Wasn’t foul baiting at all this game, y’all just wanted to reach and play physical with him all game. Upload some clips of him foul baiting tonight then. They’d already have been posted in this sub with how obsessed everyone here is about it
Vuc is better at offense but capela is a defensive anchor. Both are about equal in terms of NBA hierarchy.
https://youtu.be/wWPrAwRzReM
Dude Wood can NOT defend lol
Nah
Yeah, if Okongwu can develop he and John are our front court of the future but the deadline will be way too soon to find out. Assuming we don’t melt down and blow it up I’d be surprised if Capella is moved any time soon
Don’t agree with those either.
Nah, I’m sorry, no player deserves 19 free throws. He got that many by forcing contact and doing bs
[deleted]
He earned the giga tonight. Had one of the best individual center performances I’ve ever seen(don’t see much good center play as a hawks fan)
Gigantamax Schroeder
Where does Ayton fit in? Probably between Capela and Drummond as of now but higher potential right
Allen over Vuc? Idk bout that one chief. I wouldn't even put Capela over Vuc, although Capela has been going nuts for us lately.
They have 3 wins
Yeah, I have no doubt about that. Even with how much we've struggled after our hot start Trae is the last thing I'm worried about with this team.
DING DING DING DING DING!
holy shit lol
He does look like a homeless man lmao
yeah but what would HOU do last season with Capela injured? WB was playing horribly until they opened the floor for him. You don’t waste a year of harden/wb for capela
Plumlee has his moments
I've been there the past 2 years. The pieces are nice but we were losing almost every game. It definitely can ruin perfectly good days, especially when you watch every game.
Booo
i drank half a bottle and PTFO'd after that game 7
There were numerous plays where you could see the refs intentionally NOT give him a call. Its night and day from the fouls, but people don't watch games so they can't really understand. This guy just lost so he's emotional over it, which I do too.

I watch the game with a friend that says everything is cheating or a foul. Numerous times this game (and all games) I'll say wow Atlanta got away with this or wow Detroit got away with that. This game there were some bad calls that didn't go Atlanta's way. The Trae shooting the 3 that was called an non-shooting foul and the one where the Hawks had to challenge boggled my mind. It was so clear that was a block. I guess its because we see it on TV and the refs see it from angles but its so nerve racking. Also a lot of the non calls for Trae ends up in Hawks turnovers or wasted possessions, which is a 180 from earlier this year (he would have gotten the call) so I have no clue what people are talking about.
You saying noone got fouled that many times without watching the game is as much as I need to hear. Its pointless to discuss really.
honestly i kind of miss him in the sub
I'd love to say you're right, but I don't think he's done enough just yet to say that. I think he'll be above both of those guys in his prime but he still needs to work on a few skills.
People definitely don't watch Vuc/Orlando play.
They beat the Suns, Heat, and Celtics
They beat Boston, Phoenix and Miami still.
You have not been paying any attention to them have you? Like all but 1 of their losses have been close, they could easily be 7-7 or 8-6 instead of 3-11. They just can't close out a game.
Detroit's a tough team despite their record. Griffin's a enigma and Grant is becoming the first star Detroit had since Billups.
I get pissed because I've seen a lot of randos saying Capela is expendable to us. Until lately.

If I'm not correct didn't the Rockets get rid of Capela because of a mix of things? The injury, wanting to play small ball, coaching, etc? Isn't that when the Rockets tried out the legit smallest run and gun lineup I've ever seen and were just playing helter skelter 3 ball?
[deleted]
Nah, no one gets 19 free throws legitimately. Trae’s just a flop artist.
Yeah I'm noticing that. I know all about Vuc, considering that he destroys the Hawks every time we play the Magic lol. And I got him on my fantasy team, and he's been the 3rd best center fantasy-wise this season, behind only Jokic and Embiid. Dude's a beast, very underrated.
They have the fifth worse points differential.  They aren't good and could not "easily" be 7-7 lol
That lineup worked amazing for them until WB got injured
He’s been pretty solid throughout the year tho and put up some lines against my Heat team. Let’s not take 1 game and hold it against him. He’s been hustling for y’all
Okay, well stop living in your head's narrative and watch the game my guy.
Their point differential is -4.9. Considering that they're 3-11, to have a point differential under 5 proves my point that their losses have been close. The 3-10 Wolves have a -9.4 point differential and the 5-10 Kings have a -9.9 point differential. The 6-7 Thunder and 7-8 Magic have worse point differentials and both those teams are only 1 game under .500. So like I said, the Pistons could be hovering around .500 if they could close out a game.
I’m not watching a game where a guy shoots 19 free throws. I’d rather put a bullet through my head while jumping in front of an 18 wheeler on the freeway.
Dude.  Losing by five points a game is a massive amount.  Even if there are worse teams like the Wolves and Kings.  The Pistons are a bad team.
So if you didn't watch, how do you know the quality of the fouls? Keep following your r/nba narrative my guy.
Don't do that, but outside of the suicidal jokes the refs have pulled back on the "ghost" fouls and Trae legit got fouled. We could go on for days. We will just end by disagreeing, blame it on the Pistons because they hacked all night long and it wasn't just Trae getting fouled. I get it. You don't like it. I guess just continue not watching and maybe ignore any results.
They've only lost 1 game by more than 10 points. Look, I'm not saying they're a good team, but they've definitely choked away multiple games that they really should've won, including tonight's game against the Hawks. I guess we can chalk up their constant choking to them being a bad team, but they're not just going out and getting beat up.
Keep supporting the guy shooting 19 free throws in a game my guy. There’s a reason he’s one of the most hated guys in the league to watch
Do you realize how many stars have shot 19+ free throws in a game?
I’d love to know. How many?
I don't understand why every team hasn't adopted the "Play the Pistons every game" strategy?
Bucks padding their win total vs the Pistons smh
The bucks have now won 14 consecutive games against the Detroit pistons
Blake Griffin used to be one of my favorite players to watch and it is just... tragic... how far he’s fallen in just 2 seasons.
Box score seems legit to me
The Bucks have 3 wins against the Pistons this season.

The Pistons have 2 wins in total so far this season.
Blake is washed
Bruh the box scores are messed up
Referees really got their line spread
I can't believe they paid Plumlee that much
3 of their 8 wins are against the pistions? can't wait to see them play the nets with kyrie and harden on monday
Giannis traveling his way to Ws
And I don't understand why we haven't tried the "Have Jrue score 7 unanswered points" strategy before
Didn’t work out too well for the suns
I mean... what else should we be doing?
Feels like so many more tbh
It's never close either, we consistently fuck them up. Honestly when I'm feeling nervous about our future all it takes is a nice Pistons game to brighten my mood
Yea he just lays it up instead of throwing it down now
Do you mean in athleticism or in scummy ref baiting and cheap shots?
Breaking: bucks good, pistons bad
Watching him try to flop Giannis off the court and get bullied on both ends by Holiday while being a glorified traffic cone on offense is quite sad.
I know, I’ll fix it ASAP when it changes to the final box score
What are we supposed to do? Lose to the Pistons?
Bucks play Mavs, Nets, Lakers in next 3 games.
We don't have any quality wins yet
Me neither.
Is that going to be hardens debut
is kyrie going to be back?
Or the Celtics
Our SOS would be better if we lost all three games.
I mean he used to be extremely athletic and entertaining to watch. 

Now he’s just a broken down old man. That isn’t even that old.
Pistons fans: yes
[deleted]
We haven't really played any quality teams yet tbh. Boston the first game and we lost on a buzzer beater. (though they missed Kemba so credit to the C's.)  

And the Heat back-to-back but they're in a bit of a funk anyway.
I think he's gonna play against the Magic first
...and the list ends there.
Oh noooo!

So, anyways
Blake playing through injury in low stakes games and coming out like this on the other side is tragic.
You don't know any Pistons fans if you think that would be our response lol
pistons fans: fade for cade
No butler anyways in that one
Seeing a hobbled Blake Griffin near the end of the game was pretty sad ngl
Blake...
Blake looked so washed man. Really sad to watch
Wtf is wrong with Blake??? Dude doesn't even look like an NBA player anymore
Nice to see a good game from Kendrick Nunn. He’s been used sparingly so far this season
What happened to Blake??
Someone need to start Jerami Grant MIP campaign
Great to see Bam, Goran, and Kendrick have good games. Heat need to rattle off some wins.
I didn’t watch the game. How on earth did KZ Okpala start at SF, play 3 minutes and be a -12?
Duncan should shoot 3 pointer 20 times a game, at least 10 will go in
Nunn, and everyone looked better tonight. Also why is Blake still out there?
Ellington might fuck around and get us a draft pick.
Bam mid range game has improved so much wow. He’s hitting off the dribble, crossover pull up, step back, rise up fade and turn around jumper and it’s all fucking clean af
Bam Adebayo
jesus christ blake with 5 points in 35 minutes
Adebayo draining mid rangers and free throws gives me life
Spo that type of dude to start KZ and only play him 3 minutes.
Edrice Adebayo
Josh Jackson with that -27 +-
why is the Spurs Blazers link at the top pointing to this thread?
\#FreeRose
wow the pistons are a bad team this year
Without 3 starters
Oh no the pistons suck
I don't know whether Blake is injured, or he's just slow and not involved in the offense. What is the point of playing Blake Griffin for 35 minutes out there if he has such little usage rate and you're only letting him shoot like 7 times?

Might as well just sit him and develop other players if you're willing to lose anyway.
Needed his 35 min for some reason.
I saw him hobbled the whole game. I have no idea why that guy is playing.
This comment in every pistons pgt damn
Blake deserves better man.
I like Griffin, but it hurts to watch
Very fast decline.
Who dropped off faster; Blake or T-Mac?
Blake.
I really hate seeing stars like this. This is like Iverson in a grizzlies jersey 😔
That’s what multiple injuries to the knees does to you. He’s had to change his game completely and it hasn’t worked. He doesn’t have the same knees he had in LA and his game was so dependent on them.
multiple injuries gonna do that to you... he looks like he lost a his athleticism.  sad to watch.
kept getting injured and kept playing through them too. I have no idea why they let him play in the 2019 playoffs. He went off in two games, they still got swept by the Bucks and now he's not the same player anymore.
Maybe people are forgetting since he’s been out of the spotlight for a while, but dude was super injury prone. Remember he was even one of those guys that missed his whole rookie year, which is weirdly more common lately with The Process and Zion. There was always some injury with Blake, pretty sad.
Could this be a case where it’s just more opportunity rather than actual improvement?
I'm happy for them but they desperately need to cut down on those turnovers.
Got pulled after picking up 2 quick fouls during the Pistons' 14-2 start, and then never got on the floor again
I think we were down by almost 20 at one point in the 1st quarter.
We were down like 27-9 very early on 

It was a sad start
Heat were down 19 twice in the first quarter and KZ was having trouble guarding Jerami Grant.
Future franchise player. We're in good hands.
That block
Can you (or someone) explain to me why he did that?

Just to fill a couple early minutes?
He intentionally stayed with Detroit.
Yeah they lost to the Heat, that's embarassing
But against the Pistons, good momentum tho.
hey he was +9 lmao
Than the 40mill he’s getting paid to be dog shit?
*former stars
You could say that about every previous MIP winner, It is mix of opportunity and improvement.
Classic Heat. Either we blow a big lead, or we come back from a big deficit. I feel like it’s rarely anything else.
Spo likes starting random people so that his bench rotation stays the same.
lol i have no fucking clue.

 kz shot great in the previous loss(4/5 from 3), but we started this game out really poorly (something like down 32-15) and kz had two early fouls. I think we played super poor defense as a group to start out and maybe spo just didn't think kz is ready. he's basically a raw rookie
Spo loves to experiment and plug and play during the regular season. It's aggravating to watch but he has a process. If its not working you're out.
He got 2 quick fouls, was getting lost on defense and Miami were down by 19 quick to start, KZ has low IQ tbh so Spo probably has him on a short leash 

Mo Harkless basically took all his mins tonight since he was playing well and bringing good defense
It seems like he fouled twice in 3 minutes
We suck so much lmao
Yeah I got nothing, we kinda bad so far, but give us a break, Butler has been injured all year lol
LMAO
nah, put down.
I'm just fucking around
What a game by the G-Unit
I love the hustle from the pistons no blowouts and 1-6 the tank rolls on
Ngl our teams been surprisingly hella fun to watch this season
wanted to close this game so i could watch mavs rockets but Sviatoslav "Steph Curry" Mykhailiuk wouldn't let me
Please trade D Rose to a contender
Can't wait for the "if Giannis had a 40% 3pt shot would he be the best player in history" posts
Why the fuck did Casey take Rose out of the game?
2K numbers.
Feels like Giannis had great first half, Bucks kinda just trucked through second half.  Donte falling back to earth as a shooter kinda hurt, but Donte still played well with the awesome passing.

Bucks kinda let this game stay close with all their TOs.  Still some sloppiness on offense, but I like that they are trying to be a more aggressive passing team, even if they don't necessarily run an offense with a ton of passes.

Augustin has been pretty bad this season, but this was his best game as a Buck I think.

Jrue very good improvisational player, feels like the offense isn't really focused around him at all, but he makes good plays in the flow of the game.

Pistons have some nice young players.  Bey and Stewart look like players.
MVPGIANNIS
Honestly playing rookie/sophomores 20+ minutes and making  bucks finish with their starters is a W in my book
Get laid for Cade
Vintage D Rose. Sekou is special
Guys Giannis made more than 60% of his free throws!!! That calls for a celebration
How long before Detroit trades us Jerami Grant for scraps
Long boys of detroit cant do it all for them.
[deleted]
Depressing times since my 2005 Pistons left.
Is Blake playing next game?
Glad I switched over at the half
G-G-g-g
Grant also got exactly what he wanted. He gets to shoot 25 times a game and he's racking up numbers.
after DRose flipped the switch in the second half, part of me was hoping he’d spearhead them to a comeback upset. it looked promising for a minute, but the tank had to live on, so i’ll settle for the rally we got instead.
It stops being a tank when it never ends.
I like how you think
Kinda crazy how good the Lakers scouting department js, they drafted so many good 2nd round guys.  Then they gave them all away to clear cap space.
[deleted]
He doesn’t deserve to waste his best years post injury on a tanking team, shit id trade wiggins for him
he would be tho
I kinda wish he’d shoot those a lot less. 

I get that it’s part of Bud’s offense to take open looks, but Khris is a *way* better shooter and frankly he needs to shoot more. 

He’s averaging 5 3PA. Khris, a way better shooter, is averaging 5.5 3PA.
lol... something along the lines was said in the kings warriors game thread

[https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kqnubv/game\_thread\_sacramento\_kings\_33\_golden\_state/gi5dzk0?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/kqnubv/game_thread_sacramento_kings_33_golden_state/gi5dzk0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
Cause there's a special kid named Cade Cunningham playing for Oklahoma State.
Augustine has been great wym
Djw is due for execution to the pistons graveyard
Hey man at least we want to suck. Raps are trying  to compete and suck.
Yup they’ll bring out the crutches for him to poke people on defense with 😂
Think so it was just rest on a b2b tonight
I think he’s starting for their wheelchair team next game
Lol I hope he's happy. I wonder if someone will give him a big contract if he averages like 23 ppg on bad shooting.
Actually it just started, we were trying to be competitive until last year even tho it didn't show.
They have no additional 1st round picks, and traded away all their 2nd rounders for the next 6 years(though they have Toronto's this year and probably Golden State's in 2023). Also they have a heavily protected 1st round pick for the next like 7 years out there which somewhat limits their flexibility due to the Stepian rule.
Kinda like when the pistons gave Spencer to the Nets and a guy named Kris Middleton to the Bucks
Clippers please. They need a backup/playmaking PG.
Pretty sure he was on the trading block last season and he wanted to stay. No idea why he didn’t want to go to a winner
Probably, but if I was 7ft, with feet like Kobe, built like LeBron, hands like Kyrie and a shot like KD I'd also back myself to be the GOAT 

As it is im 5'8 on a good day, and get winded going up stairs too fast
Would he though. I honestly don't think a 3pt shot would change much for him. His 3s off the dribble are also very not, uh, fluid and very predictable
Maybe they're willing to be lose games to develop the skill? IDK.
That guy is trolling though. Check his comment history
Jalen Suggs is making a strong case right now.
This
what’s funny is that Mike Korzemba did a series seeing what the nba was gonna be like in the future and it featured the Pistons dominating the next decade starting with getting Cade
[deleted]
Mmm... pretty inconsistent so far I'd say. Pretty shaky in the Knicks game. Didn't look great against Chicago either. Early in the season and he missed some time obviously, but he's a far cry from great.
[deleted]
LMAO
By his next free agency he'll be 29 years old. If he's a proven 20+ PPG scorer by then he'll definitely get another $20M+/year long term deal.
That protected first rounder is like turning your phone off before getting drunk so you prevent future you from doing dumb shit haha.
Pistons traded Spencer to Bulls.
Middleton was kinda unique because he had a bad final year in college and then didn't do much his rookie year, so it didn't seem like much of a loss, and the Bucks specifically asked for him as a sweetener in the Jennings trade, so they didn't just give him away for nothing.  Obviously it turned out very poorly for the Pistons, but the situation wasn't the same as the Lakers just gifting what were likely to be solid bench pieces away for nothing.
what happens on bad days? do you get shorter or what
That’s always been my biggest gripe about Bud. Giannis isn’t a good 3pt shooter. He can hit 1-2 a game and that’s fine. Khris is an insanely underrated shooter and should be taking *way* more shots. Offensively we’d be better.

But it seems to be the opposite; Giannis gets the green light and Khris is told to only take efficient high quality shots.
Why not?
I guarantee that essentially the same team that took Boston to 7 in round 2 last year is trying to be competitive lol
On bad days he’s flaccid.
If you count bad posture then that actually kind of makes sense
I fully agree and the 5 three Giannis is wasting could be plays set up better for him that would help him dominate in the playoffs.
[deleted]
Oh, I thought you were being literal, like your pick was somehow 1-4 *reverse* protected.
[deleted]
Not wrong. I’m more saying mathematically 100% vs statistically 100%.
What's the record for most unsuccessful PGT attempts?
Mike Conley is been really good so far
Jeremi grant is pretty good
watching blake rn is really, really tough.
Mom said it's my turn to post the PGT.
Great first half, bad second half, but we held on unlike our game vs. NY. Glad to see Mitchell coming out aggressive like he did. I haven't seen that from him thus far this season. Rudy was very frustrating with his inability to hold onto the ball in the paint, but those 4 blocks and 20 boards made up for it. Good win. On to the next
Nice to see the Conley comeback season
Nice to see us get a dub with Bogey shooting poorly

Is Mitchell/Conley/Clarkson the best three guard rotation in the league? Its gotta be pretty damn close
Glad to get the win. Looked great early, while the shots were dropping. Rudy still playing at a DPOY level.

Bad game from BoBo. It looked like he took the wrist brace off and I wonder if that was premature.
It’s just sad watching Blake at this point
Maybe the 100th thread I can finally get an answer because it stays up long enough.



Can someone explain to me what detroit did and why grant just went from 12 ppg to 25?  If he had that talent why have they not used him before this season?  Or did he just become a stud overnight?  I don't know anything about the pistons because I never watch them


Edit - my answer came from replies that I completely forgot he was a role player on other teams.  When I went to look his stats I didnt even bother to look at teams, and I am enough unaware of him that it didnt come to my head instantly, only in hindsight I remembered
This is what, the 4th PGT for this game? Lmao what's happening
Man, Blake Griffin isn’t looking so good :,(
if I am Blake's teammate we are scrappin on site, 

it should be illegal to be this much  unbothered and bad
Hopefully I just witnessed it, because I cant imagine being more frustrated I am than right now trying to get an answer to a question about a player this game.
Sorry, what is PGT?

Edit: Post Game Thread?
Sorry, what is PGT?
Having an All-Star start to the season so far. Would love for him to get a spot finally.
Like every new PG in Utah, just needed a while to get used to the system. Playing super efficient, intelligent basketball.
The new dad powers are in effect
He was torching us in the second and third quarters, then they seemed to stop going through him. Don't understand why.
average player on a god awful team, will likely get traded then go back to his denver self
He looking like hassan whiteside out there, lumbering from end to end, setting ineffective screens, 1-7 3pt, he a shell of his former self.
He was playing at this level the last 20ish games in the regular season and in the playoffs. 

He got written off at the start of last season coming back from injury then when he got it going he got hurt again, and that cycle kept repeating.
I'd argue that Harden, Wall and Gordon are better
Sometimes when you’re a role player it can be hard to branch out and move up because you’ve already been put into the role player box. The only reason the Pistons even had the idea to do this for Grant is cuz Weaver our GM scouted him in high school and knew what he was capable of
Playing time, usage, no other scorers
mike malone thought barton was better
a little thing called "progression" also known as "improvement". when you first start something you aren't automatically the best, but if you try hard enough, work hard enough, and circumstances align, you can "progress" or "Improve".
It's really sad, but I am happier when he isn't on the court
what was ur question
The west is such a killer for guards. Idk who to bump out with CJ also playing out of his mind.
Except for George Hill. He figured everything out in a matter of days.
I think he was gassed
Who did they go through instead? Blake?
I think Casey has legit been trying to stealthly tank.
i remember him dropping [50](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25066966/blake-griffin-grateful-silence-critics-50-point-career-night-vs-sixers) on my team with straight ease like it was yesterday, and now, he's a brachiosaurus. looked like an mvp that year.
He's taking it easy this year, you're never gonna see prime Blake again but his play will pick up next year when he's gotta contract coming up. Y'all gotta remember we're tanking and he's coming back from blowing his shit out against the bucks in playoffs.
I would agree there
Well that's obvious.  I guess my question is, why would they not use him when he had this talent?  I'd really like the perspective from a pistons fan.
But you dont play 5 seasons at the same rate and magically jump 12 ppg.  That's not progression,  that's a rocket launch.  That takes some how a player is utilized.
Need Harden to get traded east. With Westbrook already east, that would be two guard spots open
Plumlee lol
They fire him if he doesn’t have a top 3 team xD
Gone are the LAC lob city days. Flying Lion RIP
He wasn't playing with the Pistons he was with the Thunder then the Nuggets. But to answer your question a lot of times when a player is put into a box by a coach that coach will get blinders and always want a player to play that role. Grant got labeled a role player with his other Teams so they didn't want to him shooting with any type of volume. He went to the Pistons because he wanted a bigger role and the Pistons offered him that. He felt he could be an All Star level player and so far he's proving himself right.
Shouldn't you be asking a Nuggets or Thunder fan? The answer is they were loaded with scorers. Detroit isn't. It's a lot easier to drop 20+ when you're the entire offense
you're saying someone can't improve drastically in one season? never happened before? nobody has gone from a role player to a quality starter? hm interesting, sir, quite interesting. i believe there is an [award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Improved_Player_Award) specifically for that type of statistic.
His best season was 2018; that’s when he dropped 50.
Therein lies the answer.   I didnt realize he was on other teams. I pigeoned holed into ppg  when I browsed him wondering who this guy was.
