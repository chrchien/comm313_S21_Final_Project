## Data files for COMM313 Final Project

* This folder should contain the data files you have used in your analysis


* You should update this README file to list and describe the files.


* You can also create additional sub-folders to better organize your data.
    * For example, you could have a folder called `raw` or `orig` to contain the original data files you downloaded and then a folder called `final` or `clean` that contains versions of these data sheets that you have worked with to clean up missing data, to subset or merge etc.
    
This folder contains all comments collected from the r/nba post-game threads on Brooklyn and Detroit games, separated into four .txt files: Nets Losses, Nets Wins, Pistons Losses, and Pistons Wins.
